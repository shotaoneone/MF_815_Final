The basic investment philosophy of the investment adviser is to seek to invest in attractively priced securities that, in its opinion, represent good, long-term investment opportunities. The investment adviser believes that an important way to accomplish this is through fundamental research, which may include analysis of credit quality, general economic conditions and various quantitative measures and, in the case of corporate obligations, meeting with company executives and employees, suppliers, customers and competitors. Securities may be sold when the investment adviser believes that they no longer represent relatively attractive investment opportunities.

Principal Investment Strategies

The fund will generally invest in larger-sized companies using a quantitative model that combines fundamental measures of a stock’s value and growth potential. To measure value, the managers may use ratios of stock price-to-earnings and stock price-to-cash flow, among others. To measure growth, the managers may use the rate of growth of a company’s earnings and cash flow and changes in its earnings estimates, as well as other factors. The model also considers price momentum. The portfolio managers also take environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") factors into account in making investment decisions.  The portfolio managers attempt to build a portfolio of stocks that provides better returns than, and a dividend yield comparable to, the S&P 500® Index, without taking on significant additional risk.

The emerging European investable universe, due to its limited geographic scope and less developed markets, tends to rely heavily on the success of certain industries and sectors. As a result, the fund may invest up to 35% of its net assets in any industry that accounts for more than 20% of the emerging European market as a whole, as measured by an index determined by T. Rowe Price to be an appropriate measure of the emerging European market (currently MSCI Emerging Markets Europe Index).

Principal Investment Strategies

The fund invests in California municipal and other debt securities with an emphasis on high-yield securities. A high-yield security is one that has been rated below investment-grade, or determined by the investment advisor to be of similar quality. Under normal market conditions, the portfolio managers invest at least 80% of the fund’s net assets in municipal securities with income payments exempt from federal and California income taxes. Cities, counties and other municipalities in California and U.S. territories usually issue these securities for public projects, such as schools, roads, and water and sewer systems. Some of these investments are not necessarily exempt from the federal alternative minimum tax.",{'source': 'MutualFundSummary/CALIFORNIA HIGH-YIELD MUNICIPAL FUND.txt'},1.0

How has Delaware International Small Cap Fund performed?

The bar chart and table below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund’s performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund’s average annual total returns for the 1-year, 5-year, and lifetime periods compare with those of a broad measure of market performance. The Fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how it will perform in the future. The returns reflect any expense caps in effect during these periods. The returns would be lower without the expense caps. You may obtain the Fund’s most recently available month-end performance by calling 800 523-1918 or by visiting our website at delawarefunds.com/performance.",{'source': 'MutualFundSummary/Delaware International Small Cap Fund.txt'},0.0
