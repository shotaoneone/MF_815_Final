              "'Fund Summary\\nInvestment Objective\\nThe fund seeks long-term capital growth.\\nFees and Expenses\\nThe following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in American Century Investments funds. More information about these and other discounts is available from your financial professional and in Calculation of Sales Charges on page 12 of the fund’s prospectus, Appendix A of the fund’s prospectus and Sales Charges in Appendix B of the statement of additional information.\\nShareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment)\\n \\n \\nInvestor\\nI1\\nA\\nC\\nR\\nMaximum Sales Charge (Load) Imposed on\\nPurchases (as a percentage of offering price)\\nNone\\nNone\\n5.75%\\nNone\\nNone\\nMaximum Deferred Sales Charge (Load)\\n(as a percentage of the lower of the original\\noffering price or redemption proceeds when redeemed\\nwithin one year of purchase)\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone²\\n1.00%\\nNone\\nMaximum Annual Account Maintenance Fee\\n(waived for unmatured Giftrust accounts or if\\neligible investments total at least $10,000)\\n$25\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\n \\nInvestor\\nI\\nA\\nC\\nR\\nManagement Fee\\n1.00%\\n0.80%\\n1.00%\\n1.00%\\n1.00%\\nDistribution and Service (12b-1) Fees\\nNone\\nNone\\n0.25%\\n1.00%\\n0.50%\\nOther Expenses\\n0.01%\\n0.01%\\n0.01%\\n0.01%\\n0.01%\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\n1.01%\\n0.81%\\n1.26%\\n2.01%\\n1.51%\\n1 \\nPrior to April 10, 2017, this class was referred to as the Institutional Class.\\n2 \\nPurchases of $1 million or more may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge of 1.00% if the shares are redeemed within one year of the date of the purchase.\\nExample\\nThe example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods, that you earn a 5% return each year, and that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same. You may be required to pay brokerage commissions on your purchases of Investor or I Class shares of the fund, which are not reflected in the example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n \\n1 year\\n3 years\\n5 years\\n10 years\\nInvestor Class\\n$103\\n$322\\n$559\\n$1,236\\nI Class\\n$83\\n$259\\n$450\\n$1,002\\nA Class\\n$696\\n$952\\n$1,228\\n$2,010\\nC Class\\n$204\\n$632\\n$1,084\\n$2,334\\nR Class\\n$154\\n$478\\n$824\\n$1,800\\nPortfolio Turnover\\nThe fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 44% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\n2#\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies \\nThe portfolio managers look for stocks of companies of all sizes they believe will increase in value over time, using an investment strategy developed by the fund’s investment advisor. In implementing this strategy, the portfolio managers make their investment decisions based primarily on their analysis of individual companies, rather than on broad economic forecasts. The portfolio managers use a variety of analytical research tools and techniques to identify companies that meet their investment criteria. Under normal market conditions, the fund’s portfolio will primarily consist of securities of companies demonstrating business improvement. Analytical indicators helping to identify signs of business improvement could include accelerating earnings or revenue growth rates, increasing cash flows, or other indications of the relative strength of a company’s business. These techniques help the portfolio managers buy or hold the stocks of companies they believe have favorable growth prospects and sell the stocks of companies whose characteristics no longer meet their criteria.\\nAlthough the portfolio managers intend to invest the fund’s assets primarily in U.S. securities, the fund may invest in securities of foreign companies when these securities meet the portfolio managers’ standards of selection.\\nThe fund may write covered calls on a portion of the fund’s holdings in common stock when the portfolio managers believe call premiums are attractive relative to the price of the underlying security.\\nPrincipal Risks \\n•\\nGrowth Stocks — Investments in growth stocks may be more volatile than other stocks and the overall stock market. These stocks are typically priced higher than other stocks because of their growth potential, which may or may not be realized.\\n•\\nSmall and Mid Cap Stocks — The fund invests in mid-sized and smaller companies, which may be more volatile and subject to greater risk than larger companies. Smaller companies may have limited financial resources, product lines and markets, and their securities may trade less frequently and in more limited volumes than the securities of larger companies, which could lead to higher transaction costs.\\n•\\nStyle Risk — If at any time the market is not favoring the fund’s growth investment style, the fund’s gains may not be as big as, or its losses may be bigger than, those of other equity funds using different investment styles.\\n•\\nForeign Securities — The fund may invest in foreign securities, which can be riskier than investing in U.S. securities. Securities of foreign issuers may be less liquid, more volatile and harder to value than U.S. securities.\\n•\\nCovered Call Risk  — Writing covered calls may limit the fund’s ability to participate in price increases of the underlying securities and could lower the fund’s return.\\n•\\nPrice Volatility — The value of the fund’s shares may fluctuate significantly in the short term.\\n•\\nMarket Risk — The value of the fund’s shares will go up and down based on the performance of the companies whose securities it owns and other factors generally affecting the securities market.\\n•\\nPrincipal Loss – At any given time your shares may be worth less than the price you paid for them. In other words, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a bank deposit, and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.\\nFund Performance \\nThe following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The bar chart shows changes in the fund’s performance from year to year for Investor Class shares. The table shows how the fund’s average annual returns for the periods shown compared with those of a broad measure of market performance. The fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the fund will perform in the future. For current performance information, please visit americancentury.com. \\nSales charges and account fees, if applicable, are not reflected in the bar chart. If those charges were included, returns would be less than those shown.\\n\\n3#\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalendar Year Total Returns \\nchart-4e88d1b1ec1288e862aa01.jpg\\nHighest Performance Quarter (1Q 2012): 18.71% Lowest Performance Quarter (4Q 2008): -26.56%\\nAverage Annual Total Returns \\nFor the calendar year ended December 31, 2017\\n1 year\\n5 years\\n10 years\\nSince Inception\\nInception Date\\nInvestor Class Return Before Taxes\\n24.87%\\n14.13%\\n6.76%\\n—\\n11/25/1983\\nReturn After Taxes on Distributions\\n22.57%\\n11.48%\\n5.36%\\n—\\n11/25/1983\\nReturn After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund  Shares\\n15.98%\\n10.85%\\n5.22%\\n—\\n11/25/1983\\nI Class Return Before Taxes\\n25.14%\\n14.36%\\n—\\n15.32%\\n09/30/2011\\nA Class1 Return Before Taxes\\n17.42%\\n12.51%\\n5.87%\\n—\\n09/30/2011\\nC Class1 Return Before Taxes\\n23.63%\\n12.99%\\n5.70%\\n—\\n09/30/2011\\nR Class1 Return Before Taxes\\n24.24%\\n13.57%\\n6.23%\\n—\\n09/30/2011\\nRussell 3000® Growth Index\\n   (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)\\n29.59%\\n17.15%\\n9.93%\\n—\\n—   \\n \\n1 \\nHistorical performance for A, C and R Classes prior to their inception is based on the performance of Investor Class shares. A, C and R Class performance has been adjusted to reflect differences in sales charges, if applicable, and expenses between classes.\\nThe after-tax returns are shown only for Investor Class shares. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or IRAs.\\nPortfolio Management \\nInvestment Advisor \\nAmerican Century Investment Management, Inc. \\nPortfolio Managers \\nGregory J. Woodhams , CFA, Co-CIO, Global Growth Equity, Senior Vice President and Senior Portfolio Manager, has been a member of the team that manages the fund since 2018.\\nJoseph Reiland , CFA, Vice President and Portfolio Manager, has been a member of the team that manages the fund since 2018.\\n\\n4#\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares  \\nYou may purchase or redeem shares of the fund on any business day through our website at americancentury.com, in person (at one of our Investor Centers), by mail (American Century Investments, P.O. Box 419200, Kansas City, MO 64141-6200), by telephone at 1-800-345-2021 (Investor Services Representative) or 1-800-345-3533 (Business, Not-For-Profit and Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plans), or through a financial intermediary. Shares may be purchased and redemption proceeds received by electronic bank transfer, by check or by wire. \\nUnless otherwise specified below, the minimum initial investment amount to open an account is $2,500 ($2,000 for Coverdell Education Savings Accounts). Investors opening accounts through financial intermediaries may open an account with $250 for Investor, A, C and R Classes, but the financial intermediaries may require their clients to meet different investment minimums. The minimum may be waived for broker-dealer sponsored wrap program accounts, fee based accounts, and accounts through bank/trust and wealth management advisory organizations. \\nThe minimum initial investment amount for I Class is generally $5 million ($3 million for endowments and foundations), but the minimum may be waived if you have an aggregate investment in the American Century family of funds of $10 million or more ($5 million for endowments and foundations). This includes accounts held directly with American Century and those held through a financial intermediary. \\nFor Investor, A, C and R Classes, there is no minimum initial investment amount for certain employer-sponsored retirement plans, however, financial intermediaries or plan recordkeepers may require plans to meet different minimums. For purposes of fund minimums, employer-sponsored retirement plans do not include SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs or SARSEPs.  Employer-sponsored retirement plans are not eligible to invest in the I Class.\\nThere is a $50 minimum for subsequent purchases, except there is no subsequent purchase minimum for financial intermediaries or employer-sponsored retirement plans. \\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares Through a Giftrust®  \\nPrior to June 21, 2017, All Cap Growth shares could be purchased to establish a Giftrust, which was a product created by American Century as a way to invest in the fund for someone other than yourself through a one-time gift held in an irrevocable trust.\\nAs of June 21, 2017, no new Giftrusts may be opened. However, additional shares may be purchased for Giftrusts established prior to August 1, 2002, by check or by wire.\\nOnce a Giftrust matures, the shares are transferred out of the Giftrust and into a new account registered in the beneficiary’s individual name. The beneficiary may purchase additional shares or redeem shares in the new account as indicated above in the Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares section.\\nTax Information \\nFund distributions are generally taxable as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred account such as a 401(k) or individual retirement account (in which case you may be taxed upon withdrawal of your investment from such account).  \\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries \\nIf you purchase the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank, insurance company, plan sponsor or financial professional), the fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.'"

Investors may also pay commissions or other fees to their financial intermediary when they buy and hold shares of the Fund, which are not reflected below. You may qualify for a reduced sales charge on purchases of Class A shares if you invest, or agree to invest over a 13-month period, at least $100,000 in Eaton Vance funds. Certain financial intermediaries also may offer variations in Fund sales charges to their customers as described in Appendix A \\u2013 Financial Intermediary Sales Charge Variations in this Prospectus. More information about these and other discounts is available from your financial intermediary and in Sales Charges on page 20 of this Prospectus and page 21 of the Fund\\u2019s Statement of Additional Information.\\n\\nShareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment)\\tClass A\\tClass C\\tClass I\\nMaximum Sales Charge (Load) Imposed on Purchases (as a percentage of offering price)\\t2.25%\\tNone\\tNone\\nMaximum Deferred Sales Charge (Load) (as a percentage of the lower of net asset value at purchase or redemption)\\tNone\\t1.00%\\tNone\\n \\n\\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\tClass A\\tClass C\\tClass I\\nManagement Fees\\t0.55%\\t0.55%\\t0.55%\\nDistribution and Service (12b-1) Fees\\t0.25%\\t1.00%\\tNone\\nOther Expenses\\t0.10%\\t0.10%\\t0.10%\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\t0.90%\\t1.65%\\t0.65%\\nExample. This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, that the operating expenses remain the same and that any expense reimbursement arrangement remains in place for the contractual period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\tExpenses with Redemption\\tExpenses without Redemption\\n \\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nClass A shares\\t$315\\t$506\\t$712\\t$1,308\\t$315\\t$506\\t$712\\t$1,308\\nClass C shares\\t$268\\t$520\\t$897\\t$1,955\\t$168\\t$520\\t$897\\t$1,955\\nClass I shares\\t$66\\t$208\\t$362\\t$810\\t$66\\t$208\\t$362\\t$810\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d the portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 54% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations, the interest on which is exempt from regular federal income tax (the \\u201c80% Policy\\u201d). In seeking the Fund\\u2019s investment objective, the portfolio managers emphasize tax-exempt income. The Fund normally invests in municipal obligations rated in the three highest rating categories (those rated A or higher by S&P Global Ratings (\\u201cS&P\\u201d), Fitch Ratings (\\u201cFitch\\u201d) or Moody\\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\\u201cMoody\\u2019s\\u201d)) or, if unrated, determined by the investment adviser to be of comparable quality at the time of purchase. The Fund will not invest more\\n\\nEaton Vance TABS Municipal Bond Funds\\t3\\tProspectus dated June 1, 2018\\n \\nthan 50% of its net assets in municipal obligations rated A at the time of purchase by S&P, Fitch or Moody\\u2019s or, if unrated, determined by the investment adviser to be of comparable quality. For purposes of rating restrictions, if securities are rated differently by two or more rating agencies, the highest rating is used. The Fund may continue to hold securities that are downgraded (including bonds downgraded to below investment grade credit quality (\\u201cjunk bonds\\u201d)) if the investment adviser believes it would be advantageous to do so. The Fund will not invest in a municipal obligation the interest on which the Fund\\u2019s investment adviser believes is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.\\n\\nFor its investment in municipal obligations, the Fund invests primarily in general obligation or revenue bonds. The Fund currently targets an average portfolio duration of approximately 2 - 4.5 years and an average weighted portfolio maturity of approximately 3 - 6 years, but may invest in securities of any maturity or duration, and may in the future alter its maturity or duration target range. The Fund may use various techniques to shorten or lengthen its dollar-weighted average portfolio duration, including the acquisition of municipal obligations at a premium or discount. The portfolio managers generally will seek to enhance after-tax total return by actively engaging in relative value trading within the portfolio to take advantage of price opportunities in the markets for municipal obligations. With respect to 20% of its net assets, the Fund may invest in municipal obligations that are not exempt from regular federal income tax, direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury and/or obligations of U.S. Government agencies, instrumentalities and government-sponsored enterprises. The Fund may also invest in cash and money market instruments.\\n\\nThe investment adviser\\u2019s process for selecting municipal obligations for purchase and sale generally includes consideration of the creditworthiness of the issuer or person obligated to repay the obligation. In evaluating creditworthiness, the investment adviser considers ratings assigned by rating agencies and generally performs additional credit and investment analysis.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nMarket Risk. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic, political and financial events (whether real, expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. The frequency and magnitude of such changes in value cannot be predicted. Certain securities and other investments held by the Fund may experience increased volatility, illiquidity, or other potentially adverse effects in reaction to changing market conditions. Actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve or foreign central banks to stimulate or stabilize economic growth, such as decreases or increases in short-term interest rates, could cause high volatility in markets. No active trading market may exist for certain investments, which may impair the ability of the Fund to sell or to realize the current valuation of such investments in the event of the need to liquidate such assets. Fixed-income markets may experience periods of relatively high volatility in an environment where U.S. treasury yields are rising.\\n\\nMunicipal Obligation Risk. The amount of public information available about municipal obligations is generally less than for corporate equities or bonds, meaning that the investment performance of municipal obligations may be more dependent on the analytical abilities of the investment adviser than stock or corporate bond investments. The secondary market for municipal obligations also tends to be less well-developed and less liquid than many other securities markets, which may limit the Fund\\u2019s ability to sell its municipal obligations at attractive prices. The differences between the price at which an obligation can be purchased and the price at which it can be sold may widen during periods of market distress. Less liquid obligations can become more difficult to value and be subject to erratic price movements. The increased presence of nontraditional participants (such as proprietary trading desks of investment banks and hedge funds) or the absence of traditional participants (such as individuals, insurance companies, banks and life insurance companies) in the municipal markets may lead to greater volatility in the markets because non-traditional participants may trade more frequently or in greater volume. \\n\\nInterest Rate Risk. In general, the value of income securities will fluctuate based on changes in interest rates. The value of these securities is likely to increase when interest rates fall and decline when interest rates rise. Generally, securities with longer durations are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than shorter duration securities, causing them to be more volatile. Conversely, fixed income securities with shorter durations will be less volatile but may provide lower returns than fixed income securities with longer durations. The Fund may own individual investments that have longer durations. In a rising interest rate environment, the durations of income securities that have the ability to be prepaid or called by the issuer may be extended. In a declining interest rate environment, the proceeds from prepaid or maturing instruments may have to be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\\n\\nCredit Risk. Investments in municipal obligations and other debt obligations (referred to below as \\u201cdebt instruments\\u201d) are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled principal and interest. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may reduce the capacity of the party obligated to make principal and interest payments on such instruments and may lead to defaults. Such non-payments and defaults may reduce the value of Fund shares and income distributions. The value of debt instruments also may decline because of concerns about the issuer\\u2019s ability to make principal and interest payments. In addition, the credit ratings of debt instruments may be lowered if the financial condition of the party obligated to make payments with respect to such instruments deteriorates. In order to enforce its rights in the\\n\\nEaton Vance TABS Municipal Bond Funds\\t4\\tProspectus dated June 1, 2018\\n \\nevent of a default, bankruptcy or similar situation, the Fund may be required to retain legal or similar counsel, which may increase the Fund\\u2019s operating expenses and adversely affect net asset value. Municipal obligations may be insured as to principal and interest payments. If the claims-paying ability or other rating of the insurer is downgraded by a rating agency, the value of such obligations may be negatively affected.\\n\\nRisks of Principal Only Investments. Principal only investments entitle the Fund to receive the stated value of such investment when held to maturity. The values of principal only investments are subject to greater fluctuation in response to changes in market interest rates than obligations that pay interest currently. The Fund will accrue income on these investments and distribute that income each year. The Fund may be required to sell other investments to obtain cash needed for such income distributions.\\n\\nU.S. Government Securities Risk. Although certain U.S. Government-sponsored agencies (such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association) may be chartered or sponsored by acts of Congress, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. U.S. Treasury securities generally have a lower return than other obligations because of their higher credit quality and market liquidity.\\n\\nTax Risk. Income from tax-exempt municipal obligations could be declared taxable because of changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the relevant taxing authority or the non-compliant conduct of the issuer of an obligation.\\n\\nMoney Market Instrument Risk. Money market instruments may be adversely affected by market and economic events, such as a sharp rise in prevailing short-term interest rates; adverse developments in the banking industry, which issues or guarantees many money market instruments; adverse economic, political or other developments affecting issuers of money market instruments; changes in the credit quality of issuers; and default by a counterparty.\\n\\nGeneral Fund Investing Risks. The Fund is not a complete investment program and there is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. It is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The Fund is designed to be a long-term investment vehicle and is not suited for short-term trading. Investors in the Fund should have a long-term investment perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value. Purchase and redemption activities by Fund shareholders may impact the management of the Fund and its ability to achieve its investment objective(s). In addition, the redemption by one or more large shareholders or groups of shareholders of their holdings in the Fund could have an adverse impact on the remaining shareholders in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund\\u2019s performance from year to year and how the Fund\\u2019s average annual returns over time compare with those of two broad-based securities market indices.\\n\\nThe Fund commenced operations on March 27, 2009 and is the successor to the operations of a private limited partnership (the \\u201cPredecessor Account\\u201d). The Predecessor Account was managed by Eaton Vance and had substantially the same investment objective, policies and strategies as the Fund. However, the Predecessor Account was not a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \\u201c1940 Act\\u201d) or a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \\u201cCode\\u201d), and therefore the Predecessor Account was not subject to the investment limitations, diversification requirements and other restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act and/or the Code. If such requirements were applicable to the Predecessor Account, the performance shown may have been adversely affected.\\n\\nEaton Vance TABS Municipal Bond Funds\\t5\\tProspectus dated June 1, 2018\\n \\n \\n\\nThe performance of each Class for the period prior to March 27, 2009 is that of the Predecessor Account. The returns in the bar chart for periods after March 27, 2009 are for Class A shares of the Fund and do not reflect a sales charge. If the sales charge was reflected, the returns would be lower. The Fund\\u2019s performance for certain periods after March 27, 2009 reflects the effects of expense reductions. Absent these reductions, performance for certain periods would have been lower. Effective February 17, 2015, the Fund changed its name, objective and investment strategy to invest at least 80% of its net assets in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations, the interest on which is exempt from regular federal income tax. Past performance (both before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated Fund performance information can be obtained by visiting www.eatonvance.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the ten years ended December 31, 2017, the highest quarterly total return for the Fund or Predecessor Account was 5.03% for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and the lowest quarterly return for the Fund or Predecessor Account was -2.36% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The year-to-date total return through the end of the most recent calendar quarter (December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018) was -0.99%.\\n\\nAverage Annual Total Return as of December 31, 2017\\tOne Year\\tFive Years\\tTen Years\\nClass A Return Before Taxes\\t-0.26%\\t0.45%\\t2.45%\\nClass A Return After Taxes on Distributions\\t-0.30%\\t0.34%\\t---\\nClass A Return After Taxes on Distributions and the Sale of Class A Shares\\t0.40%\\t0.56%\\t---\\nClass C Return Before Taxes\\t0.21%\\t0.14%\\t2.01%\\nClass I Return Before Taxes\\t2.32%\\t1.14%\\t2.90%\\nBloomberg  Barclays  5 Year Municipal Bond Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)\\t3.14%\\t1.83%\\t3.54%\\nBloomberg Barclays Municipal Managed Money 1-7 Year Bond Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)\\t2.41%\\t1.38%\\t2.98%\\nThese returns reflect the maximum sales charge for Class A (2.25%) and any applicable contingent deferred sales charge (\\u201cCDSC\\u201d) for Class C. The performance shown above for each Class for the period prior to March 27, 2009 (commencement of operations) is that of the Predecessor Account adjusted to reflect any applicable sales charge or CDSC of the Class but not adjusted for any other differences in expenses. If adjusted for such differences, returns would be different. Investors cannot invest directly in an Index.\\n\\nAfter-Tax Return is calculated using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates and does not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder\\u2019s tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions, and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-deferred accounts or to shares held by non-taxable entities. After-tax returns for other Classes of shares will vary from the after-tax returns presented for Class A shares. Return After Taxes on Distributions for a period may be the same as Return Before Taxes for that period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Also, Return After Taxes on distributions and Sale of Fund Shares for a period may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares. After-Tax Returns are not shown for the Ten Years ending December 31, 2017 because the Predecessor Account, unlike a registered investment company, was not required to make annual income distributions to its investors.\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nInvestment Adviser.

It illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you were to invest $10,000 in the Fund\\u2019s shares. This example assumes that the Fund provides a return of 5% each year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table. You would incur these hypothetical expenses whether or not you redeem your investment at the end of the given period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\n$8\\t$26\\t$45\\t$103\\n \\n\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the fiscal period from September 26, 2017, to January 31, 2018, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 1% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Transition Index, an interim index that will gradually increase exposure to other real estate-related investments while proportionately reducing exposure to other stocks based on their weightings in the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index. The MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index is made up of stocks of large, mid-size, and small U.S. companies within the real estate sector, as classified under the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). The GICS real estate sector is composed of equity real estate investment trusts (known as REITs), which includes specialized REITs, and real estate management and development companies.\\n\\nThe Fund attempts to replicate the Index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.\\n\\n2\\n\\n \\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Industry concentration risk, which is the chance that the stocks of REITs and other real estate-related investments will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. Because the Fund concentrates its assets in these stocks, industry concentration risk is high.\\n\\n\\u2022 Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund\\u2019s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a limited number of companies, which could cause the Fund to underperform the overall stock market.\\n\\n\\u2022 Interest rate risk, which is the chance that REIT stock prices overall will decline and that the cost of borrowing for REITs will increase because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk is high for the Fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Investment style risk, which is the chance that the returns from the stocks of REITs and other real estate-related investments\\u2014which typically are small- or mid-capitalization stocks\\u2014will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, these stocks have performed quite differently from the overall market.\\n\\n\\u2022 Nondiversification risk, which is the chance that the Fund may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a particular issuer or group of issuers or may own larger positions of an issuer\\u2019s voting stock than a diversified fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Asset concentration risk, which is the chance that, because the Fund\\u2019s target index (and therefore the Fund) tends to be heavily weighted in its ten largest holdings, the Fund\\u2019s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe Fund has not been in operation long enough to report a full calendar-year return.

During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 24% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund invests primarily in common stocks and seeks to invest in companies that appear to offer superior opportunities for growth of capital. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in common stocks and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\nThe investment adviser uses a system of multiple portfolio managers in managing the fund\\u2019s assets. Under this approach, the portfolio of the fund is divided into segments managed by individual managers who decide how their respective segments will be invested.\\n\\nThe fund relies on the professional judgment of its investment adviser to make decisions about the fund\\u2019s portfolio investments. The basic investment philosophy of the investment adviser is to seek to invest in attractively valued companies that, in its opinion, represent good, long-term investment opportunities. The investment adviser believes that an important way to accomplish this is through fundamental analysis, which may include meeting with company executives and employees, suppliers, customers and competitors. Securities may be sold when the investment adviser believes that they no longer represent relatively attractive investment opportunities.\\n\\n7     American Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPrincipal risks\\n\\nThis section describes the principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s principal investment strategies. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks and other securities held by the fund may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental or governmental agency responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the fund may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nInvesting in growth-oriented stocks \\u2014 Growth-oriented common stocks and other equity-type securities (such as preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks and convertible bonds) may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments. These risks may be even greater in the case of smaller capitalization stocks.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, that could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by the fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund actively manages the fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the fund is subject to the risk that the methods and analyses employed by the investment adviser in this process may not produce the desired results. This could cause the fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. You should consider how this fund fits into your overall investment program.\\n\\nAmerican Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus     8\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvestment results The following bar chart shows how the investment results of the Class 1 shares of the fund have varied from year to year, and the following table shows how the fund\\u2019s average annual total returns for various periods compare with a broad measure of securities market results and other applicable measures of market results.

These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your individual financial advisor to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your individual financial advisor or visit your financial intermediary\\u2019s website for more information. The fund is not sold directly to the general public but instead is offered as an underlying investment option for variable insurance contracts. In addition to payments described above, the fund and its related companies may make payments to the sponsoring insurance company (or its affiliates) for distribution and/or other services. These payments may be a factor that the insurance company considers in including the fund as an underlying investment option in the variable insurance contract.

You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in Class A shares of eligible funds that are part of the family of mutual funds sponsored by Allianz. More information about these and other discounts is available in the \\u201cClasses of Shares\\u201d section beginning on page 98 of the Fund\\u2019s prospectus or from your financial advisor. In addition, if you purchase shares through a specific intermediary, you may be subject to different sales charges including reductions in or waivers of such charges. More information about these intermediary-specific sales charge variations is available in Appendix A to the Fund\\u2019s prospectus (\\u201cIntermediary Sales Charge Discounts and Waivers\\u201d).\\n \\n\\nShareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment)\\n\\n \\n\\nShare Class\\t \\t\\nMaximum Sales Charge (Load) Imposed\\n\\non Purchases (as a percentage of offering price)\\n\\n \\t\\nMaximum Contingent Deferred Sales Charge (CDSC) (Load)\\n\\n(as a percentage of the lower of original purchase price or NAV)(1)\\n\\nClass A\\t \\t5.50%\\t \\t1%\\nClass C\\t \\tNone\\t \\t1%\\nClass T\\t \\t2.50%\\t \\tNone\\nInstitutional\\t \\tNone\\t \\tNone\\nClass R6\\t \\tNone\\t \\tNone\\n \\n\\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\n\\n \\n\\nShare Class\\t \\tManagement\\nFees\\t \\t\\nDistribution\\n\\nand/or Service\\n\\n(12b-1) Fees\\n\\n \\tOther\\nExpenses\\t \\t\\nTotal Annual\\n\\nFund Operating\\n\\nExpenses\\n\\nClass A\\t \\t1.20%\\t \\t0.25%\\t \\t[    ]%\\t \\t[    ]%\\nClass C\\t \\t1.20\\t \\t1.00\\t \\t[    ]\\t \\t[    ]\\nClass T\\t \\t1.20\\t \\t0.25\\t \\t[    ]\\t \\t[    ]\\nInstitutional\\t \\t1.10\\t \\tNone\\t \\t[    ]\\t \\t[    ]\\nClass R6\\t \\t[    ]\\t \\tNone\\t \\t[    ]\\t \\t[    ]\\n \\t(1) \\t \\t\\nFor Class A shares, the CDSC is imposed only in certain circumstances where shares are purchased without a front-end sales charge at the time of purchase.

The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in shares of the Fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the noted class of shares for the time periods indicated, your investment has a 5% return each year, and the Fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, the Examples show what your costs would be based on these assumptions.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\t \\tExample:  Assuming you redeem your shares at the end of each period\\t \\t \\tExample:  Assuming you do not redeem your shares\\t \\nShare Class\\t \\t1 Year\\t \\t \\t3 Years\\t \\t \\t5 Years\\t \\t \\t10 Years\\t \\t \\t1 Year\\t \\t \\t3 Years\\t \\t \\t5 Years\\t \\t \\t10 Years\\t \\nClass A\\t \\t$\\t[    \\t] \\t \\t$\\t[    \\t] \\t \\t$\\t[    \\t] \\t \\t$\\t[    \\t] \\t \\t$\\t[    \\t] \\t \\t$\\t[    \\t] \\t \\t$\\t[    \\t] \\t \\t$\\t[    \\t] \\nClass C\\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\nClass T\\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\nInstitutional\\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\nClass R6\\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\t \\t \\t[    \\t] \\n \\n\\nPortfolio Turnover.  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). The Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was [    ]% of the average value of its portfolio. High levels of portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes for you if your Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Examples above, can adversely affect the Fund\\u2019s investment performance.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund seeks to achieve its objective by normally investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings made for investment purposes) in health sciences-related companies. The Fund considers health sciences-related companies to include companies that design, manufacture or sell products or services used for or in connection with healthcare, medicine or life sciences. The Fund will invest primarily in common stocks and other equity securities. Although the Fund may invest in companies of any market capitalization, the Fund does not currently intend to invest more than 15% of its assets in companies with market capitalizations below $1 billion. The Fund\\n\\n \\n\\n18\\t \\tAllianz Funds\\nTable of Contents\\nAllianzGI Health Sciences Fund (continued)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\t\\nmay invest in U.S. and non-U.S. companies, and currently expects the majority of its non-U.S. investments will normally be in Asia and Western Europe. The Fund may invest up to 15% of its assets in emerging market securities (but no more than 10% in any one emerging market country). In analyzing specific companies for possible investment, the portfolio managers ordinarily look for the following characteristics: higher than average growth and strong potential for capital appreciation; substantial capacity for growth in revenue through either an expanding market or market share; a strong balance sheet; superior management; strong commitment to research and product development; and differentiated or superior products and services or a steady stream of new products and services. In addition to common stocks and other equity securities (such as preferred stocks, convertible securities and warrants), the Fund may invest in securities issued in initial public offerings (IPOs), and may utilize foreign currency exchange contracts, options, stock index futures contracts, short sales and other derivative instruments. Although the Fund did not invest significantly in derivative instruments as of the most recent fiscal year end, it may do so at any time. While the Fund may invest in derivatives of any kind, it expects to purchase put and call options on securities for hedging, risk management or other purposes.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nThe principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return, are (in alphabetical order after the first five risks):\\n \\n\\nMarket Risk:  The Fund will be affected by factors influencing the U.S. or global economies and securities markets or relevant industries or sectors within them.\\n\\n \\n\\nIssuer Risk:  The Fund will be affected by factors specific to the issuers of securities and other instruments in which the Fund invests, including actual or perceived changes in the financial condition or business prospects of such issuers.\\n\\n \\n\\nEquity Securities Risk:  Equity securities may react more strongly to changes in an issuer\\u2019s financial condition or prospects than other securities of the same issuer.\\n\\n \\n\\nFocused Investment Risk (Health Sciences-Related Risk):  Focusing on a limited number of issuers, sectors (such as the health sciences sector), industries or geographic regions increases risk and volatility.\\n\\n \\n\\nSmaller Company Risk:  Securities issued by smaller companies may be more volatile and present increased liquidity risk relative to securities issued by larger companies.\\n\\n \\n\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk:  An issuer or counterparty may default on obligations.\\n\\n \\n\\nCurrency Risk:  The values of non-U.S. securities may fluctuate with currency exchange rates and exposure to non-U.S. currencies may subject the Fund to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar.\\n\\n \\n\\nDerivatives Risk:  Derivative instruments are complex, have different characteristics than their underlying assets and are subject to additional risks, including leverage, liquidity and valuation.\\n\\n \\n\\nEmerging Markets Risk:  Non-U.S. investment risk may be particularly high to the extent that the Fund invests in emerging market securities. These securities may present market, credit, currency, liquidity, legal, political, technical and other risks different from, or greater than, the risks of investing in developed countries.\\n\\n \\n\\nIPO Risk:  Securities purchased in initial public offerings have no trading history, limited issuer information and increased volatility.\\n\\n \\n\\nLeveraging Risk:  Instruments and transactions that constitute leverage magnify gains or losses and increase volatility.\\n\\n \\n\\nLiquidity Risk:  The lack of an active market for investments may cause delay in disposition or force a sale below fair value.\\n\\n \\n\\nManagement Risk:  The Fund will be affected by the allocation determinations, investment decisions and techniques of the Fund\\u2019s management.\\n\\n \\n\\nNon-U.S. Investment Risk:  Non-U.S. securities markets and issuers may be more volatile, smaller, less liquid, less transparent and subject to less oversight, particularly in emerging markets.\\n\\n \\n\\nShort Selling Risk:  Short selling enhances leveraging risk and involves counterparty risk and the risk of unlimited loss.\\n\\n \\n\\nTurnover Risk:  High levels of portfolio turnover increase transaction costs and taxes and may lower investment performance.\\n\\n \\n\\nPlease see \\u201cSummary of Principal Risks\\u201d in the Fund\\u2019s prospectus for a more detailed description of the Fund\\u2019s risks. It is possible to lose money on an investment in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\n \\n\\nProspectus\\t \\t \\t19\\t \\nTable of Contents\\nAllianzGI Health Sciences Fund (continued)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPerformance Information\\n\\nThe performance information below provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in its total return from year to year and by comparing the Fund\\u2019s average annual total returns with those of a sector-specific broad-based market index and a performance average of similar mutual funds. The bar chart and the information to its right show performance of the Fund\\u2019s Class A shares, but do not reflect the impact of sales charges (loads). If they did, returns would be lower than those shown. The Fund\\u2019s Institutional Class shares were not outstanding during the time periods shown. Other share classes would have different performance due to the different expenses they bear. Performance in the Average Annual Total Returns table reflects the impact of sales charges. For periods prior to the inception date of a share class, performance information shown for such class may be based on the performance of an older class of shares that dates back to the Fund\\u2019s inception, as adjusted to reflect fees and expenses paid by the newer class. Similarly, for periods prior to a reorganization of the Fund, in which a predecessor fund was merged into the Fund, the performance information is based on the performance of the predecessor fund, adjusted to reflect fees and expenses paid by the particular share class of the Fund. These adjustments generally result in estimated performance results that are different from the actual results of the predecessor class and/or the predecessor fund, as the case may be, due to differing levels of fees and expenses paid. Details regarding the calculation of the Fund\\u2019s class-by-class performance, including a discussion of any performance adjustments, are provided under \\u201cAdditional Performance Information\\u201d in the Fund\\u2019s prospectus and SAI. Past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily predictive of future performance.

Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor\\u2019s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund shares through tax-advantaged arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of Fund shares at the end of the measurement period. After-tax returns are for Class A shares only. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary.\\n\\n \\n\\n20\\t \\tAllianz Funds\\nTable of Contents\\nAllianzGI Health Sciences Fund (continued)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nManagement of the Fund \\n\\nInvestment Adviser and Administrator  Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC (\\u201cAllianzGI U.S.\\u201d)\\n \\n\\nPortfolio Managers\\n\\nPeter Pirsch, CFA, lead portfolio manager, director, and senior analyst, has managed the Fund since 2018.\\n\\n \\n\\nBret Jones, CFA, portfolio manager, director and senior analyst, has managed the Fund since 2018.\\n\\n \\n\\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares\\n\\nYou may purchase or sell (redeem) shares of the Fund on any business day through a broker, dealer, or other financial intermediary (for Class T shares, such intermediary must have an agreement with the Distributor to sell Class T shares), or directly from the Fund\\u2019s transfer agent by mail (Allianz Global Investors Distributors LLC, P.O. Box 8050, Boston, MA 02266-8050) for Class A and Class C shares, or directly from the Fund\\u2019s transfer agent by mail (Allianz Institutional Funds, P.O. Box 219968, Kansas City, MO 64121-9968) for Institutional Class shares and Class R6, or as further described in the Fund\\u2019s prospectus and SAI. Additionally, certain direct shareholders may be able to purchase or redeem shares of the Fund online by visiting our website, us.allianzgi.com, clicking on the \\u201cAccount Access\\u201d link at the top of that webpage, and following instructions. Some restrictions may apply. To avoid delays in a purchase or redemption, please call 1-800-988-8380 for Class A, Class C and Class T shares and 1-800-498-5413 for Institutional Class and Class R6 shares with any questions about the requirements before submitting a request. Generally, purchase and redemption orders for Fund shares are processed at the net asset value (NAV) next calculated after an order is received by the distributor or an authorized intermediary. NAVs are determined only on days when the New York Stock Exchange is open for regular trading. For Class A, Class C and Class T shares, the minimum initial investment in the Fund is $1,000 and the minimum subsequent investment is $50. For Institutional Class shares, the minimum initial investment in the Fund is $1 million and no minimum is needed to add to an existing account, though minimums may be modified for certain financial intermediaries that aggregate trades on behalf of investors. For Class R6 shares, there is no minimum initial investment and no minimum is needed to add to an existing account for specified benefit plans and other eligible investors.\\n \\n\\nTax Information\\n\\nThe Fund\\u2019s distributions are generally taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account.\\n \\n\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries\\n\\nIf you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund, its distributor, its investment adviser or their affiliates may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary\\u2019s Web site for more information.\",\n          \"American Funds 2055 Target Date Retirement Fund\\n\\nInvestment objectives Depending on the proximity to its target date, the fund will seek to achieve the following objectives to varying degrees: growth, income and conservation of capital. The fund will increasingly emphasize income and conservation of capital by investing a greater portion of its assets in bond, equity-income and balanced funds as it approaches and passes its target date. In this way, the fund seeks to balance total return and stability over time.\\n\\nFees and expenses of the fund This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was less than 1% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\n8     American Funds Target Date Retirement Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund will attempt to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a mix of American Funds in different combinations and weightings. The underlying American Funds represent a variety of fund categories, including growth funds, growth-and-income funds, equity-income funds, balanced funds and fixed income funds. The fund categories represent differing investment objectives. For example, growth funds seek long-term growth primarily through investing in both U.S. stocks and stocks of issuers domiciled outside the U.S. Growth-and-income funds seek long-term growth and income primarily through investments in stocks. Equity-income and balanced funds generally strive for income and growth through stocks and/or bond investments, while fixed income funds seek current income through bond investments. The fund is designed for investors who plan to retire in, or close to, the year designated in the fund\\u2019s name.\\n\\nThe investment adviser may periodically rebalance or modify the asset mix of the funds and change the underlying fund investments. According to its current investment approach, the investment adviser will continue to manage the fund for approximately thirty years after the fund reaches its target date. Thirty years after its target date, the fund may be combined with other funds in a single portfolio with an investment allocation that will not evolve beyond that which is in effect at that time.\\n\\nThe following chart illustrates the investment approach of the fund by showing how its investment in the various fund categories will change over time. The allocations shown reflect the fund\\u2019s target allocations as of January 1, 2019.\\n\\nInvestment approach\\n\\n\\n\\nThe investment adviser anticipates that the fund will invest its assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below the investment approach set forth above. For example, a 40% target allocation to growth funds is not expected to be greater than 50% nor less than 30%. The investment adviser will continuously monitor the fund and may make modifications to either the investment approach or the underlying fund allocations that the investment adviser believes could benefit shareholders.\\n\\nAmerican Funds Target Date Retirement Series / Prospectus     9\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPrincipal risks This section describes the principal risks associated with investing in the fund and its underlying funds. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s investment strategies.\\n\\nAllocation risk \\u2014 Investments in the fund are subject to risks related to the investment adviser\\u2019s allocation choices. The selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund\\u2019s assets could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives. For investors who are close to or in retirement, the fund\\u2019s equity exposure may result in investment volatility that could reduce an investor\\u2019s available retirement assets at a time when the investor has a need to withdraw funds. For investors who are farther from retirement, there is a risk the fund may invest too much in investments designed to ensure capital conservation and current income, which may prevent the investor from meeting his or her retirement goals.\\n\\nFund structure \\u2014 The fund invests in underlying funds and incurs expenses related to the underlying funds. In addition, investors in the fund will incur fees to pay for certain expenses related to the operations of the fund. An investor holding the underlying funds directly and in the same proportions as the fund would incur lower overall expenses but would not receive the benefit of the portfolio management and other services provided by the fund.\\n\\nUnderlying fund risks \\u2014 Because the fund\\u2019s investments consist of underlying funds, the fund\\u2019s risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. For this reason, it is important to understand the risks associated with investing in the underlying funds, as described below.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the underlying funds\\u2019 investment strategies.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks, bonds and other securities held by the underlying funds may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental, governmental agency or central bank responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the underlying funds may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance, major litigation against the issuer, changes in government regulations affecting the issuer or its competitive environment and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nInvesting in stocks \\u2014 Investing in stocks may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments. As a result, the value of the underlying funds may be subject to sharp, short-term declines in value. Income provided by an underlying fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available at, the companies in which the underlying fund invests. As the fund nears its target date, a decreasing proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will be invested in underlying funds that invest primarily in stocks. Accordingly, these risks are expected to be more significant the further the fund is removed from its target date and are expected to lessen as the fund approaches its target date.\\n\\nInvesting in debt instruments \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, bonds and other debt securities held by an underlying fund may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the effective maturities and credit ratings of these securities.\\n\\nRising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. A general rise in interest rates may cause investors to sell debt securities on a large scale, which could also adversely affect the price and liquidity of debt securities and could also result in increased redemptions from the fund. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund failing to recoup the full amount of its initial investment and having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities generally have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter maturity debt securities.\\n\\nBonds and other debt securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer or guarantor will weaken or be perceived to be weaker, and/or an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default. A downgrade or default affecting any of the underlying funds\\u2019 securities could cause the value of the underlying funds\\u2019 shares to decrease. Lower quality debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality debt securities. Credit risk is gauged, in part, by the credit ratings of the debt securities in which the underlying fund invests. However, ratings are only the opinions of the rating agencies issuing them and are not guarantees as to credit quality or an evaluation of market risk. The underlying funds\\u2019 investment adviser relies on its own credit analysts to research issuers and issues in seeking to assess credit and default risks. These risks will be more significant as the fund approaches and passes its target date because a greater proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will consist of underlying funds that primarily invest in bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in lower rated debt instruments \\u2014 Lower rated bonds and other lower rated debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuer\\u2019s creditworthiness than those of higher quality debt securities. The market prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of higher quality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. These risks may be increased with respect to investments in lower quality, higher yielding debt securities rated Ba1 or below and BB+ or below by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser or unrated but determined by the investment adviser to be of equivalent quality, which securities are sometimes referred to as \\u201cjunk bonds.\\u201d\\n\\n10     American Funds Target Date Retirement Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nLiquidity risk \\u2014 Certain underlying fund holdings may be or become difficult or impossible to sell, particularly during times of market turmoil. Illiquidity may result from the lack of an active market for a holding, legal or contractual restrictions on resale, or the reduced number and capacity of market participants to make a market in such holding. Market prices for less liquid or illiquid holdings may be volatile, and reduced liquidity may have an adverse impact on the market price of such holdings. Additionally, the sale of less liquid or illiquid holdings may involve substantial delays (including delays in settlement) and additional costs and the underlying fund may be unable to sell such holdings when necessary to meet its liquidity needs or may be forced to sell at a loss.\\n\\nInvesting in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities \\u2014 Mortgage-related securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities, include debt obligations that represent interests in pools of mortgages or other income-bearing assets, such as consumer loans or receivables. Such securities often involve risks that are different from or more acute than the risks associated with investing in other types of debt securities. Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are subject to changes in the payment patterns of borrowers of the underlying debt, potentially increasing the volatility of the securities and an underlying fund\\u2019s net asset value. When interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to refinance or prepay their debt before its stated maturity. This may result in an underlying fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities, effectively reducing the underlying fund\\u2019s income. Conversely, if interest rates rise and borrowers repay their debt more slowly than expected, the time in which the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are paid off could be extended, reducing an underlying fund\\u2019s cash available for reinvestment in higher yielding securities. Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to the risk that underlying borrowers will be unable to meet their obligations and the value of property that secures the mortgages may decline in value and be insufficient, upon foreclosure, to repay the associated loans. Investments in asset-backed securities are subject to similar risks.\\n\\nInvesting in securities backed by the U.S. government \\u2014 Securities backed by the U.S. Treasury or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are guaranteed only as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity. Accordingly, the current market values for these securities will fluctuate with changes in interest rates and the credit rating of the U.S. government. Securities issued by government-sponsored entities and federal agencies and instrumentalities that are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. government.\\n\\nInvesting in future delivery contracts \\u2014 An underlying fund may enter into contracts, such as to-be-announced contracts and mortgage dollar rolls, that involve an underlying fund selling mortgage-related securities and simultaneously contracting to repurchase similar securities for delivery at a future date at a predetermined price. This can increase the underlying fund\\u2019s market exposure, and the market price of the securities that the underlying fund contracts to repurchase could drop below their purchase price. While an underlying fund can preserve and generate capital through the use of such contracts by, for example, realizing the difference between the sale price and the future purchase price, the income generated by the underlying fund may be reduced by engaging in such transactions. In addition, these transactions may increase the turnover rate of the underlying fund.\\n\\nInvesting in small companies \\u2014 Investing in smaller companies may pose additional risks. For example, it is often more difficult to value or dispose of small company stocks and more difficult to obtain information about smaller companies than about larger companies. Furthermore, smaller companies often have limited product lines, operating histories, markets and/or financial resources, may be dependent on one or a few key persons for management, and can be more susceptible to losses. Moreover, the prices of their stocks may be more volatile than stocks of larger, more established companies, particularly during times of market turmoil.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as nationalization, currency blockage or the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, each of which could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by an underlying fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\nAmerican Funds Target Date Retirement Series / Prospectus     11\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in emerging markets \\u2014 Investing in emerging markets may involve risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in the securities markets of developed countries. For instance, emerging market countries may have less developed legal and accounting systems than those in developed countries. The governments of these countries may be less stable and more likely to impose capital controls, nationalize a company or industry, place restrictions on foreign ownership and on withdrawing sale proceeds of securities from the country, and/or impose punitive taxes that could adversely affect the prices of securities. In addition, the economies of these countries may be dependent on relatively few industries that are more susceptible to local and global changes. Securities markets in these countries can also be relatively small and have substantially lower trading volumes. As a result, securities issued in these countries may be more volatile and less liquid, and may be more difficult to value, than securities issued in countries with more developed economies and/or markets. Less certainty with respect to security valuations may lead to additional challenges and risks in calculating the underlying fund\\u2019s net asset value. Additionally, emerging markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades and the holding of securities by banks, agents and depositories that are less established than those in developed countries.\\n\\nInvesting in derivatives \\u2014 The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and a derivative instrument may expose the underlying fund to losses in excess of its initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult to value, difficult for the underlying fund to buy or sell at an opportune time or price and difficult to terminate or otherwise offset. The underlying fund\\u2019s use of derivatives may result in losses to the underlying fund, and investing in derivatives may reduce the underlying fund\\u2019s returns and increase the underlying fund\\u2019s price volatility. The underlying fund\\u2019s counterparty to a derivative transaction (including, if applicable, the underlying fund\\u2019s clearing broker, the derivatives exchange or the clearinghouse) may be unable or unwilling to honor its financial obligations in respect of the transaction.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund and to the underlying funds actively manages each underlying fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the underlying funds are subject to the risk that the methods and analyses, including models, tools and data, employed by the investment adviser in this process may be flawed or incorrect and may not produce the desired results. This could cause an underlying fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. You should consider how this fund fits into your overall investment program.\\n\\n12     American Funds Target Date Retirement Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvestment results The following bar chart shows how the fund\\u2019s investment results have varied from year to year, and the following table shows how the fund\\u2019s average annual total returns for various periods compare with a broad measure of securities market results and other applicable measures of market results.

Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\t \\t \\t \\t \\n \\t1 year\\t3 years\\t5 years\\t10 years\\nClass 1\\t$55\\t$173\\t$302\\t$677\\nPortfolio turnover The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 88% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund normally will invest at least 90% of its assets in income-producing securities (with at least 50% of its assets in common stocks and other equity securities). The fund invests primarily in a broad range of income-producing securities, including common stocks and bonds. In seeking to provide a level of current income that exceeds the average yield on U.S. stocks, the fund generally looks to the average yield on stocks of companies listed on the S&P 500 Index. The fund may also invest significantly in common stocks, bonds and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\nThe investment adviser uses a system of multiple portfolio managers in managing the fund\\u2019s assets. Under this approach, the portfolio of the fund is divided into segments managed by individual managers who decide how their respective segments will be invested.\\n\\nThe fund relies on the professional judgment of its investment adviser to make decisions about the fund\\u2019s portfolio investments. The basic investment philosophy of the investment adviser is to seek to invest in attractively valued securities that, in its opinion, represent good, long-term investment opportunities. The investment adviser believes that an important way to accomplish this is through fundamental analysis, which may include meeting with company executives and employees, suppliers, customers and competitors. Securities may be sold when the investment adviser believes that they no longer represent relatively attractive investment opportunities.\\n\\n29     American Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPrincipal risks\\n\\nThis section describes the principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s principal investment strategies. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks, bonds and other securities held by the fund may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental or governmental agency responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the fund may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nInvesting in income-oriented stocks \\u2014 Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests.\\n\\nInvesting in debt instruments \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, bonds and other debt securities held by the fund may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the effective maturities and credit ratings of these securities.\\n\\nRising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities generally have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter maturity debt securities.\\n\\nBonds and other debt securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer will weaken and/or an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default. Lower quality debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality debt securities. Credit risk is gauged, in part, by the credit ratings of the debt securities in which the fund invests. However, ratings are only the opinions of the rating agencies issuing them and are not guarantees as to credit quality or an evaluation of market risk. The fund\\u2019s investment adviser relies on its own credit analysts to research issuers and issues in seeking to mitigate various credit and default risks.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, that could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by the fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund actively manages the fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the fund is subject to the risk that the methods and analyses employed by the investment adviser in this process may not produce the desired results. This could cause the fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. You should consider how this fund fits into your overall investment program.\\n\\nAmerican Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus     30\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvestment results The following bar chart shows how the investment results of the Class 1 shares of the fund have varied from year to year, and the following table shows how the fund\\u2019s average annual total returns for various periods compare with a broad measure of securities market results and other applicable measures of market results. This information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The 70%/30% MSCI ACWI/Bloomberg Barclays Index is a composite blend of 70% of the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) and 30% of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index and represents a broad measure of the global stock and bond markets, including market sectors in which the fund may invest. The Lipper Global Equity Income Funds Average includes funds that disclose investment objectives and/or strategies reasonably comparable to those of the fund. Past investment results (before and after taxes) are not predictive of future investment results. Figures shown reflect fees and expenses associated with an investment in the fund, but do not reflect insurance contract fees and expenses. If insurance contract fees and expenses were included, results would have been lower.

These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your individual financial advisor to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your individual financial advisor or visit your financial intermediary\\u2019s website for more information. The fund is not sold directly to the general public but instead is offered as an underlying investment option for variable insurance contracts. In addition to payments described above, the fund and its related companies may make payments to the sponsoring insurance company (or its affiliates) for distribution and/or other services. These payments may be a factor that the insurance company considers in including the fund as an underlying investment option in the variable insurance contract. The prospectus (or other offering document) for your variable insurance contract may contain additional information about these payments.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The example assumes that you are not participating in the Fidelity\\u00ae systematic withdrawal plan.\\n\\nLet's say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that your shareholder fees and the annual operating expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated:\\n\\n1 year \\t$48 \\n3 years \\t$149 \\n5 years \\t$260 \\n10 years \\t$585 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe fund will not incur transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells shares of underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio), but it could incur transaction costs if it were to buy and sell other types of securities directly. If the fund were to buy and sell other types of securities directly, a higher portfolio turnover rate could indicate higher transaction costs and could result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. Such costs, if incurred, would not be reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example and would affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 46% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nInvesting primarily in a combination of Fidelity\\u00ae domestic equity funds, international equity funds, bond funds, and short-term funds (underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds) to seek to achieve the fund's investment objective consistent with a payment strategy to be administered through a complementary systematic withdrawal plan.\\nAllocating assets according to a stable neutral asset allocation strategy shown in the glide path below. FMR Co., Inc. (the Adviser) may modify the fund\\u2019s neutral asset allocations from time to time when in the interests of shareholders.\\nBuying and selling futures contracts (both long and short positions) in an effort to manage cash flows efficiently, remain fully invested, or facilitate asset allocation.\\n\\nAllocating assets among underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds and futures according to a stable neutral asset allocation of approximately:\\n   \\tDomestic Equity Funds* \\t17% \\n   \\tInternational Equity Funds* \\t7% \\n   \\tBond Funds* \\t46% \\n   \\tShort-Term Funds* \\t30% \\n\\n* The Adviser may change these percentages over time. As a result of the active asset allocation strategy (discussed below), actual allocations may differ from the neutral allocations above.\\n\\nThe Adviser may use an active asset allocation strategy to increase or decrease neutral asset class exposures reflected above by up to 10% for equity funds, bond funds and short-term funds to reflect the Adviser's market outlook, which is primarily focused on the intermediate term. The asset allocations in the glide path and pie chart above are referred to as neutral because they do not reflect any decisions made by the Adviser to overweight or underweight an asset class.\\nThe fund's investment objective is intended to support a payment strategy designed to be implemented through a shareholder's voluntary participation in a complementary systematic withdrawal plan that will enable shareholders to receive regular payments from the fund based on their expected required minimum distributions from certain types of retirement accounts as mandated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). However, shareholders may invest in the fund and not participate in the plan.\\n\\nInvestors should refer to the \\\"Features and Policies\\\" section of the prospectus for a summary of how the payment strategy and plan are designed to operate.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nThe fund is designed for investors who seek to convert accumulated assets into regular payments over time. A shareholder's participation in the systematic withdrawal plan will result in the gradual withdrawal of the value of the shareholder's account in the fund. The fund's share price fluctuates, which means you could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nAsset Allocation Risk.  The fund is subject to risks resulting from the Adviser's asset allocation decisions. If FMRC's asset allocation strategy does not work as intended, the fund may not achieve its objective. If the fund is unable to achieve its objective, the payment strategy may not work as intended. The selection of underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among various asset classes could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives. In addition, the fund's active asset allocation strategy may cause the fund to have a risk profile different than that portrayed above from time to time and may increase losses.\\nInvesting in Other Funds.  The fund bears all risks of investment strategies employed by the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives.\\nStock Market Volatility.  Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Different parts of the market, including different market sectors, and different types of securities can react differently to these developments.\\nInterest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt or money market security to decrease.\\nForeign Exposure.  Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, can be more volatile than the U.S. market due to increased risks of adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can perform differently from the U.S. market.\\nIndustry Exposure.  Market conditions, interest rates, and economic, regulatory, or financial developments could significantly affect a single industry or group of related industries.\\nPrepayment.  The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security's maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest rates change.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease. Lower-quality debt securities (those of less than investment-grade quality, also referred to as high yield debt securities or junk bonds) and certain types of other securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality of the issuer. The value of lower-quality debt securities and certain types of other securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.\\nCorrelation to Index.  The performance of an underlying index fund and its index may vary somewhat due to factors such as fees and expenses of the underlying fund, transaction costs, sample selection, regulatory restrictions, and timing differences associated with additions to and deletions from the index.\\nPassive Management Risk.  An underlying fund is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of an underlying fund's index or of the actual securities included in the index. This differs from an actively managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, an underlying fund's performance could be lower than actively managed funds that may shift their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers.\\nLeverage Risk.  Leverage can increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly.\\nInflation-Protected Debt Exposure.  Increases in real interest rates can cause the price of inflation-protected debt securities to decrease. Interest payments on inflation-protected debt securities can be unpredictable.\\nCommodity-Linked Investing.  The value of commodities and commodity-linked investments may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as weather, political, tax, and other regulatory and market developments. Commodity-linked investments may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying commodity, instruments, or measures.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund. The information illustrates the changes in the performance of the fund's shares from year to year and compares the performance of the fund's shares to the performance of a securities market index and an additional index over various periods of time. The indexes have characteristics relevant to the fund's investment strategies. Index descriptions appear in the \\\"Additional Index Information\\\" section of the prospectus.

These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing your intermediary and your investment professional to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your investment professional or visit your intermediary's web site for more information.\",\n          \"American Funds College 2027 Fund\\n\\nInvestment objectives The fund will seek to achieve the following objectives to varying degrees: growth, income and preservation of capital, depending on the proximity to its target date. The target date is meant to roughly correspond to the year in which the fund beneficiary will start to withdraw funds to meet higher education expenses. The fund will increasingly emphasize income and preservation of capital by investing a greater portion of its assets in bond, equity-income and balanced funds as it approaches and passes its target date. In this way, the fund seeks to achieve an appropriate balance of total return and stability during different time periods.\\n\\nFees and expenses of the fund This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. You may qualify for a Class 529-A sales charge discount if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $100,000 in American Funds.

The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 10% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund will attempt to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a mix of American Funds in different combinations and weightings. The underlying American Funds represent a variety of fund categories such as growth funds, growth-and-income funds, equity-income funds, balanced funds and bond funds. The fund categories represent differing investment objectives. For example, growth funds seek long-term growth primarily through investing in both U.S. stocks and stocks of issuers domiciled outside the U.S. Growth-and-income funds seek long-term growth-and-income primarily through investments in stocks. Equity-income and balanced funds generally strive for income and growth through stocks and/or bond investments, while bond funds seek current income through bond investments. The fund is designed for investors who plan to attend college in, or close to, the year designated in the fund\\u2019s name.\\n\\nThe investment adviser may periodically rebalance or modify the asset mix of the funds and change the underlying fund investments. According to its current investment approach, the percentage of the fund invested in different categories will change until the fund reaches its target date. Upon reaching its target date, the fund will be principally invested in fixed-income funds and may merge into the Enrollment Fund, which will also be principally invested in fixed-income funds.\\n\\nThe fund\\u2019s investment adviser periodically reviews the investment strategies and asset mix of the underlying funds. The investment adviser will also consider whether overall market conditions would favor a change in the exposure of the fund to various asset types or geographic regions. Based on these considerations, the investment adviser may make adjustments to underlying fund holdings by adjusting the percentage of individual underlying funds within the fund, or adding or removing underlying funds. The investment adviser may also determine not to change the underlying fund allocations, particularly in response to short-term market movements, if in its opinion the combination of underlying funds is appropriate to meet the fund\\u2019s investment objective.\\n\\nWith respect to its fixed-income investments, the underlying funds in which the fund invests may hold debt securities with a wide range of quality and maturities. The fund may invest in underlying funds with significant exposure to bonds rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser, or unrated but determined by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser to be of equivalent quality. Securities rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below are sometimes referred to as \\u201cjunk bonds.\\u201d Exposure to lower rated securities may help the fund achieve its objective of providing current income.\\n\\nThe underlying funds may hold securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government, securities issued by federal agencies and instrumentalities and securities backed by mortgages or other assets. The underlying funds may also invest in the debt securities of governments, agencies, corporations and other entities domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\n23     American Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nThe following chart illustrates the investment approach of the fund by showing how its investment in the various fund categories will change over time. The allocations shown reflect the fund\\u2019s target allocations as of January 1, 2019.\\n\\nInvestment approach\\n\\n\\n\\nThe investment adviser anticipates that the fund will invest its assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below the investment approach set forth above. For example, a 20% target allocation to growth funds is not expected to be greater than 30% or less than 10%. The investment adviser will continuously monitor the fund and may make modifications to either the investment approach or the underlying fund allocations that the investment adviser believes could benefit shareholders.\\n\\nPrincipal risks This section describes the principal risks associated with investing in the fund and its underlying funds. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s investment strategies.\\n\\nAllocation risk \\u2014 Investments in the fund are subject to risks related to the investment adviser\\u2019s allocation choices. The selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund\\u2019s assets could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nFund structure \\u2014 The fund invests in underlying funds and incurs expenses related to the underlying funds. In addition, investors in the fund will incur fees to pay for certain expenses related to the operations of the fund. An investor holding the underlying funds directly and in the same proportions as the fund would incur lower overall expenses but would not receive the benefit of the portfolio management and other services provided by the fund.\\n\\nUnderlying fund risks \\u2014 Because the fund\\u2019s investments consist of underlying funds, the fund\\u2019s risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. For this reason, it is important to understand the risks associated with investing in the underlying funds, as described below.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the underlying funds\\u2019 investment strategies.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks, bonds and other securities held by the underlying funds may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental, governmental agency or central bank responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the underlying funds may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance, major litigation against the issuer, changes in government regulations affecting the issuer or its competitive environment and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nAmerican Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus     24\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in stocks \\u2014 Investing in stocks may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments. As a result, the value of the underlying funds may be subject to sharp, short-term declines in value. Income provided by an underlying fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available at, the companies in which the underlying fund invests. As the fund nears its target date, a decreasing proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will be invested in underlying funds that invest primarily in stocks. Accordingly, these risks are expected to be more significant the further the fund is removed from its target date and are expected to lessen as the fund approaches its target date.\\n\\nInvesting in debt instruments \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, bonds and other debt securities held by an underlying fund may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the effective maturities and credit ratings of these securities.\\n\\nRising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. A general rise in interest rates may cause investors to sell debt securities on a large scale, which could also adversely affect the price and liquidity of debt securities and could also result in increased redemptions from the fund. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund failing to recoup the full amount of its initial investment and having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities generally have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter maturity debt securities.\\n\\nBonds and other debt securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer or guarantor will weaken or be perceived to be weaker, and/or an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default. A downgrade or default affecting any of the underlying funds\\u2019 securities could cause the value of the underlying funds\\u2019 shares to decrease. Credit risk is gauged, in part, by the credit ratings of the debt securities in which the underlying fund invests. However, ratings are only the opinions of the rating agencies issuing them and are not guarantees as to credit quality or an evaluation of market risk. The underlying funds\\u2019 investment adviser relies on its own credit analysts to research issuers and issues in seeking to assess credit and default risks. These risks will be more significant as the fund approaches its target date because a greater proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will consist of underlying funds that primarily invest in bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in lower rated debt instruments \\u2014 Lower rated bonds and other lower rated debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuer\\u2019s creditworthiness than those of higher quality debt securities. The market prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of higher quality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. These risks may be increased with respect to investments in junk bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in small companies \\u2014 Investing in smaller companies may pose additional risks. For example, it is often more difficult to value or dispose of small company stocks and more difficult to obtain information about smaller companies than about larger companies. Furthermore, smaller companies often have limited product lines, operating histories, markets and/or financial resources, may be dependent on one or a few key persons for management, and can be more susceptible to losses. Moreover, the prices of their stocks may be more volatile than stocks of larger, more established companies, particularly during times of market turmoil.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as nationalization, currency blockage or the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, each of which could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by an underlying fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\n25     American Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in emerging markets \\u2014 Investing in emerging markets may involve risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in the securities markets of developed countries. For instance, emerging market countries may have less developed legal and accounting systems than those in developed countries. The governments of these countries may be less stable and more likely to impose capital controls, nationalize a company or industry, place restrictions on foreign ownership and on withdrawing sale proceeds of securities from the country, and/or impose punitive taxes that could adversely affect the prices of securities. In addition, the economies of these countries may be dependent on relatively few industries that are more susceptible to local and global changes. Securities markets in these countries can also be relatively small and have substantially lower trading volumes. As a result, securities issued in these countries may be more volatile and less liquid, and may be more difficult to value, than securities issued in countries with more developed economies and/or markets. Less certainty with respect to security valuations may lead to additional challenges and risks in calculating the underlying fund\\u2019s net asset value. Additionally, emerging markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades and the holding of securities by banks, agents and depositories that are less established than those in developed countries.\\n\\nInvesting in derivatives \\u2014 The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and a derivative instrument may expose the underlying fund to losses in excess of its initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult to value, difficult for the underlying fund to buy or sell at an opportune time or price and difficult to terminate or otherwise offset. The underlying fund\\u2019s use of derivatives may result in losses to the underlying fund, and investing in derivatives may reduce the underlying fund\\u2019s returns and increase the underlying fund\\u2019s price volatility. The underlying fund\\u2019s counterparty to a derivative transaction (including, if applicable, the underlying fund\\u2019s clearing broker, the derivatives exchange or the clearinghouse) may be unable or unwilling to honor its financial obligations in respect of the transaction.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund and to the underlying funds actively manages each underlying fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the underlying funds are subject to the risk that the methods and analyses, including models, tools and data, employed by the investment adviser in this process may be flawed or incorrect and may not produce the desired results. This could cause an underlying fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. You should consider how this fund fits into your overall investment program.\\n\\nAmerican Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus     26\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvestment results The following bar chart shows how the fund\\u2019s investment results have varied from year to year, and the following table shows how the fund\\u2019s average annual total returns for various periods compare with a broad measure of securities market results and other applicable measures of market results.

These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your individual financial advisor to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your individual financial advisor or visit your financial intermediary\\u2019s website for more information.\",\n          \"Fund Summary\\n\\nFund/Class:\\nFidelity\\u00ae Municipal Income 2023 Fund/Fidelity Advisor\\u00ae Municipal Income 2023 Fund A, I\\n\\nInvestment Objective\\n\\nThe fund seeks as high a level of current income, exempt from federal income tax, as is consistent with the preservation of capital.\\n\\nFee Table\\n\\nThe following table describes the fees and expenses that may be incurred when you buy and hold shares of the fund. In addition to the fees and expenses described below, your broker may also require you to pay brokerage commissions on purchases and sales of certain share classes of the fund.\\n\\nYou may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in the fund or certain other Fidelity\\u00ae funds. More information about these and other discounts is available from your investment professional and in the \\\"Fund Distribution\\\" section beginning on page 50 of the prospectus. Different intermediaries may provide additional waivers or reductions of the sales charge. Please see \\u201cSales Charge Waiver Policies Applied by Certain Intermediaries\\u201d in the \\u201cAppendix\\u201d section of the prospectus.\\n\\nShareholder fees\\n\\n(fees paid directly from your investment)\\n\\n \\tClass A \\tClass I \\nMaximum sales charge (load) on purchases (as a % of offering price) \\t2.75% \\tNone \\nMaximum contingent deferred sales charge (as a % of the lesser of original purchase price or redemption proceeds) \\tNone(a) \\tNone \\n(a)  Purchases of $250,000 or more will not be subject to a front-end sales charge, but may be subject to a 0.50% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) if the intermediary firm has elected an upfront finder's fee at the time the shares are purchased, or a 0.75% CDSC if the shares purchased are recordkept in a Fidelity Advisor\\u00ae 401(k) Retirement Plan.\\n\\nAnnual Operating Expenses\\n\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a % of the value of your investment)\\n\\n \\tClass A \\tClass I \\nManagement fee \\t0.30% \\t0.30% \\nDistribution and/or Service (12b-1) fees \\t0.25% \\tNone \\nOther expenses \\t0.10% \\t0.10% \\nTotal annual operating expenses \\t0.65% \\t0.40% \\nThis example helps compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other funds.\\n\\nLet's say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that your shareholder fees and the annual operating expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated:\\n\\n \\tClass A \\tClass I \\n1 year \\t$340 \\t$41 \\n3 years \\t$477 \\t$128 \\n5 years \\t$627 \\t$224 \\n10 years \\t$1,063 \\t$505 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 12% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nNormally investing at least 80% of assets in investment-grade municipal securities whose interest is exempt from federal income tax (but may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax).\\nManaging the fund to have similar overall interest rate risk compared to a customized municipal bond index representing Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR)'s view of the performance of the fund\\u2019s competitive universe.\\nAllocating assets across different market sectors and maturities.\\nPotentially investing more than 25% of total assets in municipal securities that finance similar types of projects.\\nAnalyzing the credit quality of the issuer, security-specific features, current and potential future valuation, and trading opportunities to select investments.\\nLiquidating shortly after the fund's target end-date of June 30, 2023.\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nMunicipal Market Volatility.  The municipal market is volatile and can be significantly affected by adverse tax, legislative, or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities.\\nInterest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt security to decrease.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease.\\nDeclining Yield Risk.  As the fund approaches its liquidation date, the fund's securities will mature and the fund may reinvest the proceeds in money market securities with lower yields than the securities previously held by the fund.\\nFluctuation of Yield & Liquidation Amount Risk.  The amount of the fund's income distributions will vary over time, and the breakdown of returns between fund distributions and liquidation proceeds will not be predictable at the time of your investment, and you may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Unlike individual debt securities, which typically pay principal at maturity, the value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. You could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund. The information illustrates the changes in the performance of the fund's shares from year to year and compares the performance of the fund's shares to the performance of a securities market index and an additional index over various periods of time. The indexes have characteristics relevant to the fund's investment strategies. Index descriptions appear in the \\\"Additional Index Information\\\" section of the prospectus. Past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future performance.\\n\\nVisit institutional.fidelity.com for more recent performance information.\\n\\nYear-by-Year Returns\\n\\nThe returns in the bar chart do not reflect any applicable sales charges; if sales charges were reflected, returns would be lower than those shown.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the periods shown in the chart for Class A: \\tReturns \\tQuarter ended \\nHighest Quarter Return \\t3.65% \\tMarch 31, 2014 \\nLowest Quarter Return \\t(4.66)% \\tDecember 31, 2016 \\nYear-to-Date Return \\t(0.31)% \\tJune 30, 2018 \\nAverage Annual Returns\\n\\nUnlike the returns in the bar chart, the returns in the table reflect the maximum applicable sales charges. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates, but do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. After-tax returns for Class A are shown in the table below and after-tax returns for other classes will vary. Actual after-tax returns may differ depending on your individual circumstances. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares may be higher than other returns for the same period due to a tax benefit of realizing a capital loss upon the sale of fund shares.\\n\\nFor the periods ended December 31, 2017 \\tPast 1 year \\tLife of class(a) \\nClass A - Return Before Taxes \\t1.27% \\t1.71% \\nReturn After Taxes on Distributions \\t1.27% \\t1.70% \\nReturn After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares \\t1.49% \\t1.73% \\nClass I - Return Before Taxes \\t4.39% \\t2.57% \\nBloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index\\n(reflects no deduction for fees, expenses, or taxes) \\t5.45% \\t2.97% \\nBloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond 2023 Index Ex Tobacco/Prepaid Gas\\n(reflects no deduction for fees, expenses, or taxes) \\t4.32% \\t2.35% \\n(a)  From April 23, 2013\\n\\nInvestment Adviser\\n\\nFMR (the Adviser) is the fund's manager.

Other expenses of the Fund have been restated to exclude non-recurring prior period expenses and to reflect current fiscal year expenses. If the non-recurring prior period expenses were included in the table above, the amount stated would have been greater. Consequently, the total annual Fund operating expenses differ from the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the Financial Highlights.\\n\\n2. The investment manager has contractually agreed to waive or assume certain fees and expenses so that total annual Fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses and certain non-routine expenses) for each class of the Fund do not exceed 0.44% until September 30, 2019. The investment manager also has contractually agreed in advance to reduce its fees as a result of the Fund's investment in a Franklin Templeton money fund (acquired fund) for the next 12-month period. The Fund\\u2019s fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements have been restated to reflect current fiscal year information. Consequently, total annual Fund operating expenses after fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements differ from the ratio of expenses to average net assets net of waiver and payments shown in the Financial Highlights. Contractual fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement agreements may not be changed or terminated during the time period set forth above.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nThis Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of the period. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. The Example reflects adjustments made to the Fund's operating expenses due to the fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by management for the 1 Year numbers only. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n   \\t1 Year \\t3 Years \\nClass R6   \\t$ 30 \\t$ 708 \\nAdvisor Class   \\t$ 45 \\t$ 753 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual Fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. For the period January 23, 2018 through May 31, 2018, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 0.00% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund invests predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated investment grade debt securities and investments, including government and corporate debt securities and asset-backed securities and municipal securities. Such securities may be fixed or variable rate. Asset-backed securities are securities backed by loans, leases, and other receivables.\\n\\nAlthough the Fund may invest in individual securities of any maturity, the Fund is a term fund and is managed to mature in the year indicated in its name. Over time, the Fund\\u2019s duration and weighted average maturity will decline as its maturity date approaches. In the later months of operation, when the debt securities held by the Fund mature, the proceeds from such securities will be held in cash, cash equivalents and money market instruments, including affiliated money market funds, or invested in short-term bonds. In early December of the year indicated in the Fund\\u2019s name, the Fund is expected to consist almost entirely of cash, cash equivalents and money market instruments.\\n\\nThe Fund will terminate in early December of the year specified in its name. At that time, the Fund will make a cash distribution to then-current shareholders of its net assets after making appropriate provisions for any liabilities of the Fund. The Board may change the termination date to an earlier or later date without shareholder approval if the Board determines the change is in the best interests of Fund shareholders.\\n\\nThe Fund focuses on investment grade securities and investments or in unrated securities and investments the investment manager determines are of comparable quality. The Fund\\u2019s focus on the credit quality of its portfolio is intended to reduce credit risk and help to preserve its capital. The Fund may invest a significant portion of its total assets in U.S. dollar denominated foreign securities, including debt issued by supranational entities.\\n\\nIn choosing investments, the Fund\\u2019s investment manager selects securities in various market sectors based on the investment manager\\u2019s assessment of changing economic, market, industry and issuer conditions. The investment manager uses a \\u201ctop-down\\u201d analysis of macroeconomic trends, combined with a \\u201cbottom-up\\u201d fundamental analysis of market sectors, industries and issuers, to try to take advantage of varying sector reactions to economic events.\\n\\nThe Fund is not designed for long-term capital appreciation and does not provide a complete solution for a shareholder\\u2019s retirement income needs. Shareholders should consider other factors besides their age or retirement date, such as their risk tolerance, personal circumstances, and complete financial situation, before investing in the Fund. It is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund, including at its target maturity date. The Fund does not guarantee a level of dividends, income or principal at or before its target maturity date.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nYou could lose money by investing in the Fund. Mutual fund shares are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank, and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other agency of the U.S. government.\\n\\nCredit   An issuer of debt securities may fail to make interest payments or repay principal when due, in whole or in part. Changes in an issuer's financial strength or in a security's credit rating may affect a security's value.\\n\\nInterest Rate   When interest rates rise, debt security prices generally fall. The opposite is also generally true: debt security prices rise when interest rates fall. Interest rate changes are influenced by a number of factors, including government policy, monetary policy, inflation expectations, perceptions of risk, and supply of and demand for bonds. In general, securities with longer maturities or durations are more sensitive to interest rate changes.\\n\\nIncome   The Fund's distributions to shareholders may decline when prevailing interest rates fall, when the Fund experiences defaults on debt securities it holds, or when the Fund realizes a loss upon the sale of a debt security.\\n\\nVariable Rate Securities   Because changes in interest rates on variable rate securities (including floating rate securities) may lag behind changes in market rates, the value of such securities may decline during periods of rising interest rates until their interest rates reset to market rates. During periods of declining interest rates, because the interest rates on variable rate securities generally reset downward, their market value is unlikely to rise to the same extent as the value of comparable fixed rate securities.\\n\\nYield and Liquidation Amount   During the year prior to or in the year of the Fund\\u2019s termination date, the debt securities held by the Fund will mature and the Fund\\u2019s portfolio will transition to cash and cash equivalents, and other short-term fixed income securities. As this occurs, the Fund\\u2019s yield will generally tend to move toward the yield of cash and cash equivalents and may be lower than the yields of the debt securities previously held by the Fund or the prevailing yields for bonds in the market.\\n\\nIn addition, unlike a direct investment in a bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, the Fund will make distributions of income that vary over time. The Fund\\u2019s distributions and liquidation proceeds will not be predictable at the time of your investment.\\n\\nLiquidity   From time to time, the trading market for a particular security or type of security or other investments in which the Fund invests may become less liquid or even illiquid. Reduced liquidity will have an adverse impact on the Fund\\u2019s ability to sell such securities or other investments when necessary to meet the Fund\\u2019s liquidity needs, which may arise or increase in response to a specific economic event or because the investment manager wishes to purchase particular investments or believes that a higher level of liquidity would be advantageous. Reduced liquidity will also generally lower the value of such securities or other investments. Market prices for such securities or other investments may be relatively volatile.\\n\\nForeign Securities (non-U.S.)   Investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in U.S. securities, including risks related to currency exchange rates and policies, country or government specific issues, less favorable trading practices or regulation and greater price volatility. Certain of these risks also may apply to securities of U.S. companies with significant foreign operations.\\n\\nAsset-Backed Securities   Issuers of asset-backed securities may have limited ability to enforce the security interest in the underlying assets, and credit enhancements provided to support the securities, if any, may be inadequate to protect investors in the event of default. Like mortgage securities, asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment and extension risks.\\n\\nMarket   The market values of securities or other investments owned by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The market value of a security or other investment may be reduced by market activity or other results of supply and demand unrelated to the issuer. This is a basic risk associated with all investments. When there are more sellers than buyers, prices tend to fall. Likewise, when there are more buyers than sellers, prices tend to rise.\\n\\nManagement   The Fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed investment portfolio. The Fund's investment manager applies investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Fund, but there can be no guarantee that these decisions will produce the desired results.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nBecause the Fund does not have a full calendar year of performance, annual total return information is not available and therefore is not presented. You can obtain updated performance information by calling (800) 321-8563.\\n\\nInvestment Manager\\n\\nFranklin Advisers, Inc. (Advisers)\\n\\nPortfolio Managers\\n\\nRoger Bayston, CFA   Senior Vice President of Advisers and portfolio manager of the Fund since inception (2015).\\n\\nDavid Yuen, CFA   Portfolio Manager of Advisers and portfolio manager of the Fund since inception (2015).\\n\\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares\\n\\nYou may purchase shares of the Fund on any business day by mail (Franklin Templeton Institutional Services, P.O. Box 33030, St. Petersburg, FL 33733-8030). You may redeem shares of the Fund on any business day by mail at the address listed above, or by telephone at (800) 321-8563. The minimum initial purchase varies depending on the type of investor and could be up to $1,000,000. More information about eligibility to invest in the Fund and the applicable minimum requirements is under \\\"Your Account\\\" in the detail section of the Fund's prospectus. There is no minimum investment for subsequent purchases.\\n\\nTaxes\\n\\nThe Fund's distributions are generally taxable to you as ordinary income, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account, in which case your distributions would generally be taxed when withdrawn from the tax-deferred account.\\n\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and\\nOther Financial Intermediaries\\n\\nIf you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your financial advisor or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\",\n          \"Bond Fund\\n\\nInvestment objective The fund\\u2019s investment objective is to provide as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital.\\n\\nFees and expenses of the fund This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold an interest in Class 1 shares of the fund.

The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. The example does not reflect insurance contract expenses.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 502% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund seeks to maximize your level of current income and preserve your capital by investing primarily in bonds. Normally, the fund invests at least 80% of its assets in bonds and other debt securities, which may be represented by other investment instruments, including derivatives. The fund invests at least 65% of its assets in investment-grade debt securities (rated Baa3 or better or BBB\\u2013 or better by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, or NRSROs, designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser or unrated but determined to be of equivalent quality by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser), including cash and cash equivalents, securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. and other governments, and securities backed by mortgages and other assets. The fund may invest up to 35% of its assets in debt securities rated Ba1 or below and BB+ or below by NRSROs designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser or unrated but determined by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser to be of equivalent quality. Such securities are sometimes referred to as \\u201cjunk bonds.\\u201d The fund may invest in debt securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, including in emerging markets. The fund may also invest up to 20% of its assets in preferred stocks, including convertible and nonconvertible preferred stocks. In addition, the fund may invest, subject to the restrictions above, in contracts for future delivery of mortgage-backed securities, such as to-be-announced contracts and mortgage rolls. These contracts are normally of short duration and may be replaced by another contract prior to maturity. Each such transaction is reflected as turnover in the fund\\u2019s portfolio, resulting in a higher portfolio turnover rate than funds that do not employ this investment strategy. The fund is designed for investors seeking income and more price stability than stocks, and capital preservation over the long term.\\n\\nThe fund may invest in certain derivative instruments, such as futures contracts and swaps. A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which is based on the value of an underlying financial asset (such as a stock, bond or currency), a reference rate or a market index. The fund may invest in a derivative only if, in the opinion of the investment adviser, the expected risks and rewards of the proposed investment are consistent with the investment objective and strategies of the fund as disclosed in this prospectus and in the fund\\u2019s statement of additional information.\\n\\nThe investment adviser uses a system of multiple portfolio managers in managing the fund\\u2019s assets. Under this approach, the portfolio of the fund is divided into segments managed by individual managers who decide how their respective segments will be invested.\\n\\nThe fund relies on the professional judgment of its investment adviser to make decisions about the fund\\u2019s portfolio investments. The basic investment philosophy of the investment adviser is to seek to invest in attractively priced securities that, in its opinion, represent good, long-term investment opportunities. The investment adviser believes that an important way to accomplish this is through fundamental research, which may include analysis of credit quality, general economic conditions and various quantitative measures and, in the case of corporate obligations, meeting with company executives and employees, suppliers, customers and competitors. Securities may be sold when the investment adviser believes that they no longer represent relatively attractive investment opportunities.\\n\\nAmerican Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus     40\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPrincipal risks\\n\\nThis section describes the principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s principal investment strategies. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the bonds and other securities held by the fund may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental or governmental agency responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the fund may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nInvesting in debt instruments \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, bonds and other debt securities held by the fund may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the effective maturities and credit ratings of these securities.\\n\\nRising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities generally have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter maturity debt securities.\\n\\nBonds and other debt securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer will weaken and/or an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default. Lower quality debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality debt securities. Credit risk is gauged, in part, by the credit ratings of the debt securities in which the fund invests. However, ratings are only the opinions of the rating agencies issuing them and are not guarantees as to credit quality or an evaluation of market risk. The fund\\u2019s investment adviser relies on its own credit analysts to research issuers and issues in seeking to mitigate various credit and default risks.\\n\\nInvesting in lower rated debt instruments \\u2014 Lower rated bonds and other lower rated debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuer\\u2019s creditworthiness than those of higher quality debt securities. The market prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of higher quality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. These risks may be increased with respect to investments in junk bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities \\u2014 Mortgage-related securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities, include debt obligations that represent interests in pools of mortgages or other income-bearing assets, such as consumer loans or receivables. Such securities often involve risks that are different from or more acute than the risks associated with investing in other types of debt securities. Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are subject to changes in the payment patterns of borrowers of the underlying debt. When interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to refinance or prepay their debt before its stated maturity. This may result in the fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities, effectively reducing the fund\\u2019s income. Conversely, if interest rates rise and borrowers repay their debt more slowly than expected, the time in which the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are paid off could be extended, reducing the fund\\u2019s cash available for reinvestment in higher yielding securities.\\n\\n41     American Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in future delivery contracts \\u2014 The fund may enter into contracts, such as to-be-announced contracts and mortgage dollar rolls, that involve the fund selling mortgage-related securities and simultaneously contracting to repurchase similar securities for delivery at a future date at a predetermined price. This can increase the fund\\u2019s market exposure, and the market price of the securities that the fund contracts to repurchase could drop below their purchase price. While the fund can preserve and generate capital through the use of such contracts by, for example, realizing the difference between the sale price and the future purchase price, the income generated by the fund may be reduced by engaging in such transactions. In addition, these transactions may increase the turnover rate of the fund.\\n\\nInvesting in securities backed by the U.S. government \\u2014 Securities backed by the U.S. Treasury or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are guaranteed only as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity. Accordingly, the current market values for these securities will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Securities issued by government-sponsored entities and federal agencies and instrumentalities that are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. government.\\n\\nInvesting in inflation-linked bonds \\u2014 The values of inflation-linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates \\u2014 i.e., rates of interest after factoring in inflation. A rise in real interest rates may cause the prices of inflation-linked securities to fall, while a decline in real interest rates may cause the prices to increase. Inflation-linked bonds may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations when real interest rates rise faster than nominal interest rates. There can be no assurance that the value of an inflation-linked security will be directly correlated to changes in interest rates; for example, if interest rates rise for reasons other than inflation, the increase may not be reflected in the security\\u2019s inflation measure.\\n\\nInvesting in inflation-linked bonds may also reduce the fund\\u2019s distributable income during periods of extreme deflation. If prices for goods and services decline throughout the economy, the principal and income on inflation-linked securities may decline and result in losses to the fund.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, that could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by the fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\nInvesting in derivatives \\u2014 The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and a derivative instrument may expose the fund to losses in excess of its initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult for the fund to buy or sell at an opportune time or price and may be difficult to terminate or otherwise offset. The fund\\u2019s use of derivatives may result in losses to the fund, and investing in derivatives may reduce the fund\\u2019s returns and increase the fund\\u2019s price volatility. The fund\\u2019s counterparty to a derivative transaction (including, if applicable, the fund\\u2019s clearing broker, the derivatives exchange or the clearinghouse) may be unable or unwilling to honor its financial obligations in respect of the transaction.\\n\\nLiquidity risk \\u2014 Certain fund holdings may be deemed to be less liquid or illiquid because they cannot be readily sold without significantly impacting the value of the holdings. Liquidity risk may result from the lack of an active market for a holding, legal or contractual restrictions on resale, or the reduced number and capacity of market participants to make a market in such holding. Market prices for less liquid or illiquid holdings may be volatile, and reduced liquidity may have an adverse impact on the market price of such holdings. Additionally, the sale of less liquid or illiquid holdings may involve substantial delays (including delays in settlement) and additional costs and the fund may be unable to sell such holdings when necessary to meet its liquidity needs.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund actively manages the fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the fund is subject to the risk that the methods and analyses employed by the investment adviser in this process may not produce the desired results. This could cause the fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. You should consider how this fund fits into your overall investment program.\\n\\nAmerican Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus     42\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvestment results The following bar chart shows how the investment results of the Class 1 shares of the fund have varied from year to year, and the following table shows how the fund\\u2019s average annual total returns for various periods compare with a broad measure of securities market results and other applicable measures of market results. This information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The Lipper Core Bond Funds Average includes mutual funds that disclose investment objectives and/or strategies reasonably comparable to those of the fund. Past investment results (before and after taxes) are not predictive of future investment results. Figures shown reflect fees and expenses associated with an investment in the fund, but do not reflect insurance contract fees and expenses.

These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your individual financial advisor to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your individual financial advisor or visit your financial intermediary\\u2019s website for more information. The fund is not sold directly to the general public but instead is offered as an underlying investment option for variable insurance contracts. In addition to payments described above, the fund and its related companies may make payments to the sponsoring insurance company (or its affiliates) for distribution and/or other services. These payments may be a factor that the insurance company considers in including the fund as an underlying investment option in the variable insurance contract. The prospectus (or other offering document) for your variable insurance contract may contain additional information about these payments.\",\n          \"Eaton Vance Real Estate Fund\\n\\nInvestment Objective\\n\\nThe Fund\\u2019s investment objective is to seek total return.\\n\\nFees and Expenses of the Fund\\n\\nThis table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund. Investors may also pay commissions or other fees to their financial intermediary when they buy and hold shares of the Fund, which are not reflected below. You may qualify for a reduced sales charge on purchases of Class A shares if you invest, or agree to invest over a 13-month period, at least $50,000 in Eaton Vance funds. Certain financial intermediaries also may offer variations in Fund sales charges to their customers as described in Appendix A \\u2013 Financial Intermediary Sales Charge Variations in this Prospectus.

This expense reimbursement will continue through April 30, 2019. Any amendment to or termination of this reimbursement would require approval of the Board of Trustees. The expense reimbursement relates to ordinary operating expenses only and does not include expenses such as: brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses of unaffiliated funds, interest expense, taxes or litigation expenses. Amounts reimbursed may be recouped by the administrator during the same fiscal year to the extent actual expenses are less than the contractual expense cap during such year.\\nExample. This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, that the operating expenses remain the same and that any reimbursement arrangement remains in place for the contractual period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nClass A shares\\t$695\\t$983\\t$1,291\\t$2,165\\nClass I shares\\t$102\\t$355\\t$627\\t$1,405\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d the portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 36% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund seeks total return through a combination of capital appreciation and current income. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of companies primarily engaged in the real estate industry (the \\u201c80% Policy\\u201d). Although it invests primarily in domestic securities, the Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in foreign securities. As an alternative to holding foreign stocks directly, the Fund may invest in U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign companies that trade on U.S. exchanges, or in the over-the-counter market (including depositary receipts which evidence ownership in underlying foreign stocks). The Fund may invest in exchange-traded funds (\\u201cETFs\\u201d), a type of pooled investment vehicle, in order to\\n\\nEaton Vance Domestic Equity Funds\\t21\\tProspectus dated May 1, 2018\\n \\nmanage cash positions to seek exposure to certain market sectors. The Fund is \\u201cnon-diversified,\\u201d which means it may invest a greater percentage of its asset in the securities of a single issuer than a \\u201cdiversified\\u201d fund.\\n\\nCompanies primarily engaged in the real estate industry and other real estate-related investments may include publicly traded real estate investment trusts (\\u201cREITs\\u201d) or real estate operating companies that either own properties or make construction or mortgage loans, real estate developers, companies with substantial real estate holdings and other companies whose products and services are related to the real estate industry, such as lodging operators, brokers, property management companies, building supply manufacturers, mortgage lenders, or mortgage servicing companies. REITs tend to be small to medium-sized companies. The value of a REIT can depend on the structure of and cash flow generated by the REIT. REITs are pooled investment vehicles that have expenses of their own, so the Fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of those expenses. The Fund will not own real estate directly.\\n\\nThe portfolio manager generally seeks to purchase securities of companies that he believes are high in quality and reasonably priced in relation to their fundamental value. In selecting securities, the portfolio manager generally seeks companies believed to have the potential for above-average earnings growth and profit margins, as well as good appreciation prospects and income-producing potential. Investment decisions are made primarily on the basis of fundamental research. The portfolio manager utilizes information provided by, and the expertise of, the investment adviser\\u2019s research staff in making investment decisions. Factors the portfolio manager considers in selecting real estate companies include one or more of the following: asset quality; quality and experience of management; type and location of real estate owned; nature of a company\\u2019s real estate activities; sustainability of a company\\u2019s competitive position; balance sheet strength; free cash flow and growth thereof; and relative valuation. While stocks generally are acquired with the expectation of being held for the long term, securities may be sold if, in the opinion of the investment adviser, the price moves above a fair level of valuation, the company\\u2019s fundamentals deteriorate or to pursue more attractive investment options.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nMarket Risk. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic, political and financial events (whether real, expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. The frequency and magnitude of such changes in value cannot be predicted. Certain securities and other investments held by the Fund may experience increased volatility, illiquidity, or other potentially adverse effects in reaction to changing market conditions. Actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve or foreign central banks to stimulate or stabilize economic growth, such as decreases or increases in short-term interest rates, could cause high volatility in markets.\\n\\nEquity Securities Risk. The value of equity securities and related instruments may decline in response to adverse changes in the economy or the economic outlook; deterioration in investor sentiment; interest rate, currency, and commodity price fluctuations; adverse geopolitical, social or environmental developments; issuer and sector-specific considerations; or other factors. Market conditions may affect certain types of stocks to a greater extent than other types of stocks. If the stock market declines in value, the value of the Fund\\u2019s equity securities will also likely decline. Although prices can rebound, there is no assurance that values will return to previous levels.\\n\\nReal Estate Risk. Real estate investments are subject to risks associated with owning real estate, including declines in real estate values, increases in property taxes, fluctuations in interest rates, limited availability of mortgage financing, decreases in revenues from underlying real estate assets, declines in occupancy rates, changes in government regulations affecting zoning, land use, and rents, environmental liabilities, and risks related to the management skill and creditworthiness of the issuer. Companies in the real estate industry may also be subject to liabilities under environmental and hazardous waste laws, among others. REITs must satisfy specific requirements for favorable tax treatment and can involve unique risks in addition to the risks generally affecting the real estate industry. The Fund is not eligible for a deduction from dividends received from REITs that is available to individuals who invest directly in REITs. Changes in underlying real estate values may have an exaggerated effect to the extent that investments are concentrated in particular geographic regions or property types.\\n\\nIndustry Concentration Risk. Because the Fund concentrates its investments in the real estate industry, the value of Fund shares may be affected by events that adversely affect that industry and may fluctuate more than that of a fund that invests more broadly.\\n\\nIssuer Diversification Risk. The Fund is \\u201cnon-diversified,\\u201d which means it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than a fund that is \\u201cdiversified.\\u201d Non-diversified funds may focus their investments in a small number of issuers, making them more susceptible to risks affecting such issuers than a more diversified fund might be.\\n\\nSmaller Company Risk. The stocks of smaller, less seasoned companies are generally subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, higher transaction costs and higher investment risk than the stocks of larger, more established companies. Such companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources, may be dependent on a limited management group, and may lack substantial capital reserves or an established performance record. There may be generally less publicly available information about such companies than for larger, more established\\n\\nEaton Vance Domestic Equity Funds\\t22\\tProspectus dated May 1, 2018\\n \\ncompanies. Stocks of these companies frequently have lower trading volumes making them more volatile and potentially more difficult to value.\\n\\nForeign Investment Risk. Foreign investments can be adversely affected by political, economic and market developments abroad, including the imposition of economic and other sanctions by the United States or another country. Foreign markets may be smaller, less liquid and more volatile than the major markets in the United States, and as a result, Fund share values may be more volatile. Trading in foreign markets typically involves higher expense than trading in the United States. The Fund may have difficulties enforcing its legal or contractual rights in a foreign country. Depositary receipts are subject to many of the risks associated with investing directly in foreign instruments.\\n\\nCurrency Risk. Exchange rates for currencies fluctuate daily. The value of foreign investments may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar. Currency markets generally are not as regulated as securities markets and currency transactions are subject to settlement, custodial and other operational risks.\\n\\nETF Risk. ETFs are subject to the risks of investing in the underlying securities or other investments. ETF shares may trade at a premium or discount to net asset value and are subject to secondary market trading risks. In addition, the Fund will bear a pro rata portion of the operating expenses of an ETF in which it invests. Other pooled investment vehicles generally are subject to risks similar to those of ETFs. \\n\\nRisks Associated with Active Management. The success of the Fund\\u2019s investment strategy depends on portfolio management\\u2019s successful application of analytical skills and investment judgment. Active management involves subjective decisions.\\n\\nGeneral Fund Investing Risks. The Fund is not a complete investment program and there is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. It is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The Fund is designed to be a long-term investment vehicle and is not suited for short-term trading. Investors in the Fund should have a long-term investment perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value. Purchase and redemption activities by Fund shareholders may impact the management of the Fund and its ability to achieve its investment objective(s). In addition, the redemption by one or more large shareholders or groups of shareholders of their holdings in the Fund could have an adverse impact on the remaining shareholders in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund\\u2019s performance from year to year and how the Fund\\u2019s average annual returns over time compare with those of two broad-based securities market indices. The returns in the bar chart are for Class A shares and do not reflect a sales charge. If the sales charge was reflected, returns would be lower. Past performance (both before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. The Fund\\u2019s performance reflects the effects of expense reductions. Absent these reductions, performance would have been lower. Updated Fund performance information can be obtained by visiting www.eatonvance.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the ten years ended December 31, 2017, the highest quarterly total return for Class A was 30.70% for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, and the lowest quarterly return was -35.70% for the quarter ended December 31, 2008.\\n\\nEaton Vance Domestic Equity Funds\\t23\\tProspectus dated May 1, 2018\\n \\n \\n\\nAverage Annual Total Return as of December 31, 2017\\tOne Year\\tFive Years\\tTen Years\\nClass A Return Before Taxes\\t-2.08%\\t7.57%\\t7.03%\\nClass A Return After Taxes on Distributions\\t-3.00%\\t6.03%\\t5.90%\\nClass A Return After Taxes on Distributions and the Sale of Class A Shares\\t-1.19%\\t5.39%\\t5.19%\\nClass I Return Before Taxes\\t4.23%\\t9.13%\\t7.86%\\nDow Jones U.S. Select Real Estate Securities Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)\\t3.76%\\t9.07%\\t6.97%\\nS&P 500 Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)\\t21.83%\\t15.78%\\t8.49%\\nThese returns reflect the maximum sales charge for Class A (5.75%). The Class A performance shown above for the period prior to June 9, 2010 (commencement of operations) is the performance of Class I shares, adjusted for the sales charge that applies to Class A shares but not adjusted for any other differences in the expenses of the two classes. If adjusted for such differences, returns would be different. Investors cannot invest directly in an Index.\\n\\nAfter-tax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder\\u2019s tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions, and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-deferred accounts or to shares held by non-taxable entities. After-tax returns for other Classes of shares will vary from the after-tax returns presented for Class A shares. Return After Taxes on Distributions for a period may be the same as Return Before Taxes for that period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Also, Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares for a period may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares.\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nInvestment Adviser.

Investors may also pay commissions or other fees to their financial intermediary when they buy and hold shares of the Fund, which are not reflected below. You may qualify for a reduced sales charge on purchases of Class A shares if you invest, or agree to invest over a 13-month period, at least $100,000 in Eaton Vance funds. Certain financial intermediaries also may offer variations in Fund sales charges to their customers as described in Appendix A \\u2013 Financial Intermediary Sales Charge Variations in this Prospectus.

This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, that the operating expenses remain the same and that any expense reimbursement arrangement remains in place for the contractual period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\tExpenses with Redemption\\tExpenses without Redemption\\n \\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nClass A shares\\t$315\\t$506\\t$712\\t$1,308\\t$315\\t$506\\t$712\\t$1,308\\nClass C shares\\t$268\\t$520\\t$897\\t$1,955\\t$168\\t$520\\t$897\\t$1,955\\nClass I shares\\t$66\\t$208\\t$362\\t$810\\t$66\\t$208\\t$362\\t$810\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d the portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 54% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations, the interest on which is exempt from regular federal income tax (the \\u201c80% Policy\\u201d). In seeking the Fund\\u2019s investment objective, the portfolio managers emphasize tax-exempt income. The Fund normally invests in municipal obligations rated in the three highest rating categories (those rated A or higher by S&P Global Ratings (\\u201cS&P\\u201d), Fitch Ratings (\\u201cFitch\\u201d) or Moody\\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\\u201cMoody\\u2019s\\u201d)) or, if unrated, determined by the investment adviser to be of comparable quality at the time of purchase. The Fund will not invest more\\n\\nEaton Vance TABS Municipal Bond Funds\\t3\\tProspectus dated June 1, 2018\\n \\nthan 50% of its net assets in municipal obligations rated A at the time of purchase by S&P, Fitch or Moody\\u2019s or, if unrated, determined by the investment adviser to be of comparable quality. For purposes of rating restrictions, if securities are rated differently by two or more rating agencies, the highest rating is used. The Fund may continue to hold securities that are downgraded (including bonds downgraded to below investment grade credit quality (\\u201cjunk bonds\\u201d)) if the investment adviser believes it would be advantageous to do so. The Fund will not invest in a municipal obligation the interest on which the Fund\\u2019s investment adviser believes is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.\\n\\nFor its investment in municipal obligations, the Fund invests primarily in general obligation or revenue bonds. The Fund currently targets an average portfolio duration of approximately 2 - 4.5 years and an average weighted portfolio maturity of approximately 3 - 6 years, but may invest in securities of any maturity or duration, and may in the future alter its maturity or duration target range. The Fund may use various techniques to shorten or lengthen its dollar-weighted average portfolio duration, including the acquisition of municipal obligations at a premium or discount. The portfolio managers generally will seek to enhance after-tax total return by actively engaging in relative value trading within the portfolio to take advantage of price opportunities in the markets for municipal obligations. With respect to 20% of its net assets, the Fund may invest in municipal obligations that are not exempt from regular federal income tax, direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury and/or obligations of U.S. Government agencies, instrumentalities and government-sponsored enterprises. The Fund may also invest in cash and money market instruments.\\n\\nThe investment adviser\\u2019s process for selecting municipal obligations for purchase and sale generally includes consideration of the creditworthiness of the issuer or person obligated to repay the obligation. In evaluating creditworthiness, the investment adviser considers ratings assigned by rating agencies and generally performs additional credit and investment analysis.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nMarket Risk. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic, political and financial events (whether real, expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. The frequency and magnitude of such changes in value cannot be predicted. Certain securities and other investments held by the Fund may experience increased volatility, illiquidity, or other potentially adverse effects in reaction to changing market conditions. Actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve or foreign central banks to stimulate or stabilize economic growth, such as decreases or increases in short-term interest rates, could cause high volatility in markets. No active trading market may exist for certain investments, which may impair the ability of the Fund to sell or to realize the current valuation of such investments in the event of the need to liquidate such assets. Fixed-income markets may experience periods of relatively high volatility in an environment where U.S. treasury yields are rising.\\n\\nMunicipal Obligation Risk. The amount of public information available about municipal obligations is generally less than for corporate equities or bonds, meaning that the investment performance of municipal obligations may be more dependent on the analytical abilities of the investment adviser than stock or corporate bond investments. The secondary market for municipal obligations also tends to be less well-developed and less liquid than many other securities markets, which may limit the Fund\\u2019s ability to sell its municipal obligations at attractive prices. The differences between the price at which an obligation can be purchased and the price at which it can be sold may widen during periods of market distress. Less liquid obligations can become more difficult to value and be subject to erratic price movements. The increased presence of nontraditional participants (such as proprietary trading desks of investment banks and hedge funds) or the absence of traditional participants (such as individuals, insurance companies, banks and life insurance companies) in the municipal markets may lead to greater volatility in the markets because non-traditional participants may trade more frequently or in greater volume. \\n\\nInterest Rate Risk. In general, the value of income securities will fluctuate based on changes in interest rates. The value of these securities is likely to increase when interest rates fall and decline when interest rates rise. Generally, securities with longer durations are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than shorter duration securities, causing them to be more volatile. Conversely, fixed income securities with shorter durations will be less volatile but may provide lower returns than fixed income securities with longer durations. The Fund may own individual investments that have longer durations. In a rising interest rate environment, the durations of income securities that have the ability to be prepaid or called by the issuer may be extended. In a declining interest rate environment, the proceeds from prepaid or maturing instruments may have to be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\\n\\nCredit Risk. Investments in municipal obligations and other debt obligations (referred to below as \\u201cdebt instruments\\u201d) are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled principal and interest. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may reduce the capacity of the party obligated to make principal and interest payments on such instruments and may lead to defaults. Such non-payments and defaults may reduce the value of Fund shares and income distributions. The value of debt instruments also may decline because of concerns about the issuer\\u2019s ability to make principal and interest payments. In addition, the credit ratings of debt instruments may be lowered if the financial condition of the party obligated to make payments with respect to such instruments deteriorates. In order to enforce its rights in the\\n\\nEaton Vance TABS Municipal Bond Funds\\t4\\tProspectus dated June 1, 2018\\n \\nevent of a default, bankruptcy or similar situation, the Fund may be required to retain legal or similar counsel, which may increase the Fund\\u2019s operating expenses and adversely affect net asset value. Municipal obligations may be insured as to principal and interest payments. If the claims-paying ability or other rating of the insurer is downgraded by a rating agency, the value of such obligations may be negatively affected.\\n\\nRisks of Principal Only Investments. Principal only investments entitle the Fund to receive the stated value of such investment when held to maturity. The values of principal only investments are subject to greater fluctuation in response to changes in market interest rates than obligations that pay interest currently. The Fund will accrue income on these investments and distribute that income each year. The Fund may be required to sell other investments to obtain cash needed for such income distributions.\\n\\nU.S. Government Securities Risk. Although certain U.S. Government-sponsored agencies (such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association) may be chartered or sponsored by acts of Congress, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. U.S. Treasury securities generally have a lower return than other obligations because of their higher credit quality and market liquidity.\\n\\nTax Risk. Income from tax-exempt municipal obligations could be declared taxable because of changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the relevant taxing authority or the non-compliant conduct of the issuer of an obligation.\\n\\nMoney Market Instrument Risk. Money market instruments may be adversely affected by market and economic events, such as a sharp rise in prevailing short-term interest rates; adverse developments in the banking industry, which issues or guarantees many money market instruments; adverse economic, political or other developments affecting issuers of money market instruments; changes in the credit quality of issuers; and default by a counterparty.\\n\\nGeneral Fund Investing Risks. The Fund is not a complete investment program and there is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. It is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The Fund is designed to be a long-term investment vehicle and is not suited for short-term trading. Investors in the Fund should have a long-term investment perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value. Purchase and redemption activities by Fund shareholders may impact the management of the Fund and its ability to achieve its investment objective(s). In addition, the redemption by one or more large shareholders or groups of shareholders of their holdings in the Fund could have an adverse impact on the remaining shareholders in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund\\u2019s performance from year to year and how the Fund\\u2019s average annual returns over time compare with those of two broad-based securities market indices.\\n\\nThe Fund commenced operations on March 27, 2009 and is the successor to the operations of a private limited partnership (the \\u201cPredecessor Account\\u201d). The Predecessor Account was managed by Eaton Vance and had substantially the same investment objective, policies and strategies as the Fund. However, the Predecessor Account was not a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \\u201c1940 Act\\u201d) or a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \\u201cCode\\u201d), and therefore the Predecessor Account was not subject to the investment limitations, diversification requirements and other restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act and/or the Code. If such requirements were applicable to the Predecessor Account, the performance shown may have been adversely affected.\\n\\nEaton Vance TABS Municipal Bond Funds\\t5\\tProspectus dated June 1, 2018\\n \\n \\n\\nThe performance of each Class for the period prior to March 27, 2009 is that of the Predecessor Account. The returns in the bar chart for periods after March 27, 2009 are for Class A shares of the Fund and do not reflect a sales charge. If the sales charge was reflected, the returns would be lower. The Fund\\u2019s performance for certain periods after March 27, 2009 reflects the effects of expense reductions. Absent these reductions, performance for certain periods would have been lower. Effective February 17, 2015, the Fund changed its name, objective and investment strategy to invest at least 80% of its net assets in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations, the interest on which is exempt from regular federal income tax. Past performance (both before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated Fund performance information can be obtained by visiting www.eatonvance.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the ten years ended December 31, 2017, the highest quarterly total return for the Fund or Predecessor Account was 5.03% for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and the lowest quarterly return for the Fund or Predecessor Account was -2.36% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The year-to-date total return through the end of the most recent calendar quarter (December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018) was -0.99%.\\n\\nAverage Annual Total Return as of December 31, 2017\\tOne Year\\tFive Years\\tTen Years\\nClass A Return Before Taxes\\t-0.26%\\t0.45%\\t2.45%\\nClass A Return After Taxes on Distributions\\t-0.30%\\t0.34%\\t---\\nClass A Return After Taxes on Distributions and the Sale of Class A Shares\\t0.40%\\t0.56%\\t---\\nClass C Return Before Taxes\\t0.21%\\t0.14%\\t2.01%\\nClass I Return Before Taxes\\t2.32%\\t1.14%\\t2.90%\\nBloomberg  Barclays  5 Year Municipal Bond Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)\\t3.14%\\t1.83%\\t3.54%\\nBloomberg Barclays Municipal Managed Money 1-7 Year Bond Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)\\t2.41%\\t1.38%\\t2.98%\\nThese returns reflect the maximum sales charge for Class A (2.25%) and any applicable contingent deferred sales charge (\\u201cCDSC\\u201d) for Class C. The performance shown above for each Class for the period prior to March 27, 2009 (commencement of operations) is that of the Predecessor Account adjusted to reflect any applicable sales charge or CDSC of the Class but not adjusted for any other differences in expenses. If adjusted for such differences, returns would be different. Investors cannot invest directly in an Index.\\n\\nAfter-Tax Return is calculated using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates and does not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder\\u2019s tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions, and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-deferred accounts or to shares held by non-taxable entities. After-tax returns for other Classes of shares will vary from the after-tax returns presented for Class A shares. Return After Taxes on Distributions for a period may be the same as Return Before Taxes for that period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Also, Return After Taxes on distributions and Sale of Fund Shares for a period may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares. After-Tax Returns are not shown for the Ten Years ending December 31, 2017 because the Predecessor Account, unlike a registered investment company, was not required to make annual income distributions to its investors.\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nInvestment Adviser.

It illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you were to invest $10,000 in the Fund\\u2019s shares. This example assumes that the Fund provides a return of 5% each year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table. You would incur these hypothetical expenses whether or not you redeem your investment at the end of the given period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\n$8\\t$26\\t$45\\t$103\\n \\n\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the fiscal period from September 26, 2017, to January 31, 2018, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 1% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Transition Index, an interim index that will gradually increase exposure to other real estate-related investments while proportionately reducing exposure to other stocks based on their weightings in the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index. The MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index is made up of stocks of large, mid-size, and small U.S. companies within the real estate sector, as classified under the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). The GICS real estate sector is composed of equity real estate investment trusts (known as REITs), which includes specialized REITs, and real estate management and development companies.\\n\\nThe Fund attempts to replicate the Index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.\\n\\n2\\n\\n \\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Industry concentration risk, which is the chance that the stocks of REITs and other real estate-related investments will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. Because the Fund concentrates its assets in these stocks, industry concentration risk is high.\\n\\n\\u2022 Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund\\u2019s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a limited number of companies, which could cause the Fund to underperform the overall stock market.\\n\\n\\u2022 Interest rate risk, which is the chance that REIT stock prices overall will decline and that the cost of borrowing for REITs will increase because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk is high for the Fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Investment style risk, which is the chance that the returns from the stocks of REITs and other real estate-related investments\\u2014which typically are small- or mid-capitalization stocks\\u2014will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, these stocks have performed quite differently from the overall market.\\n\\n\\u2022 Nondiversification risk, which is the chance that the Fund may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a particular issuer or group of issuers or may own larger positions of an issuer\\u2019s voting stock than a diversified fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Asset concentration risk, which is the chance that, because the Fund\\u2019s target index (and therefore the Fund) tends to be heavily weighted in its ten largest holdings, the Fund\\u2019s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe Fund has not been in operation long enough to report a full calendar-year return.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 24% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund invests primarily in common stocks and seeks to invest in companies that appear to offer superior opportunities for growth of capital. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in common stocks and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\nThe investment adviser uses a system of multiple portfolio managers in managing the fund\\u2019s assets. Under this approach, the portfolio of the fund is divided into segments managed by individual managers who decide how their respective segments will be invested.\\n\\nThe fund relies on the professional judgment of its investment adviser to make decisions about the fund\\u2019s portfolio investments. The basic investment philosophy of the investment adviser is to seek to invest in attractively valued companies that, in its opinion, represent good, long-term investment opportunities. The investment adviser believes that an important way to accomplish this is through fundamental analysis, which may include meeting with company executives and employees, suppliers, customers and competitors. Securities may be sold when the investment adviser believes that they no longer represent relatively attractive investment opportunities.\\n\\n7     American Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPrincipal risks\\n\\nThis section describes the principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s principal investment strategies. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks and other securities held by the fund may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental or governmental agency responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the fund may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nInvesting in growth-oriented stocks \\u2014 Growth-oriented common stocks and other equity-type securities (such as preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks and convertible bonds) may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments. These risks may be even greater in the case of smaller capitalization stocks.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, that could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by the fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund actively manages the fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the fund is subject to the risk that the methods and analyses employed by the investment adviser in this process may not produce the desired results. This could cause the fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. You should consider how this fund fits into your overall investment program.\\n\\nAmerican Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus     8\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvestment results The following bar chart shows how the investment results of the Class 1 shares of the fund have varied from year to year, and the following table shows how the fund\\u2019s average annual total returns for various periods compare with a broad measure of securities market results and other applicable measures of market results.

These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your individual financial advisor to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your individual financial advisor or visit your financial intermediary\\u2019s website for more information. The fund is not sold directly to the general public but instead is offered as an underlying investment option for variable insurance contracts. In addition to payments described above, the fund and its related companies may make payments to the sponsoring insurance company (or its affiliates) for distribution and/or other services. These payments may be a factor that the insurance company considers in including the fund as an underlying investment option in the variable insurance contract. The prospectus (or other offering document) for your variable insurance contract may contain additional information about these payments.GROWTH FUND\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Investors may also pay commissions or other fees to their financial intermediary when they buy and hold shares of the Fund, which are not reflected below. You may qualify for a reduced sales charge on purchases of Class A shares if you invest, or agree to invest over a 13-month period, at least $100,000 in Eaton Vance funds. Certain financial intermediaries also may offer variations in Fund sales charges to their customers as described in Appendix A \\u2013 Financial Intermediary Sales Charge Variations in this Prospectus. More information about these and other discounts is available from your financial intermediary and in Sales Charges on page 20 of this Prospectus and page 21 of the Fund\\u2019s Statement of Additional Information.\\n\\nShareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment)\\tClass A\\tClass C\\tClass I\\nMaximum Sales Charge (Load) Imposed on Purchases (as a percentage of offering price)\\t2.25%\\tNone\\tNone\\nMaximum Deferred Sales Charge (Load) (as a percentage of the lower of net asset value at purchase or redemption)\\tNone\\t1.00%\\tNone\\n \\n\\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\tClass A\\tClass C\\tClass I\\nManagement Fees\\t0.55%\\t0.55%\\t0.55%\\nDistribution and Service (12b-1) Fees\\t0.25%\\t1.00%\\tNone\\nOther Expenses\\t0.10%\\t0.10%\\t0.10%\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\t0.90%\\t1.65%\\t0.65%\\nExample. This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, that the operating expenses remain the same and that any expense reimbursement arrangement remains in place for the contractual period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\tExpenses with Redemption\\tExpenses without Redemption\\n \\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nClass A shares\\t$315\\t$506\\t$712\\t$1,308\\t$315\\t$506\\t$712\\t$1,308\\nClass C shares\\t$268\\t$520\\t$897\\t$1,955\\t$168\\t$520\\t$897\\t$1,955\\nClass I shares\\t$66\\t$208\\t$362\\t$810\\t$66\\t$208\\t$362\\t$810\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d the portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 54% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations, the interest on which is exempt from regular federal income tax (the \\u201c80% Policy\\u201d). In seeking the Fund\\u2019s investment objective, the portfolio managers emphasize tax-exempt income. The Fund normally invests in municipal obligations rated in the three highest rating categories (those rated A or higher by S&P Global Ratings (\\u201cS&P\\u201d), Fitch Ratings (\\u201cFitch\\u201d) or Moody\\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\\u201cMoody\\u2019s\\u201d)) or, if unrated, determined by the investment adviser to be of comparable quality at the time of purchase. The Fund will not invest more\\n\\nEaton Vance TABS Municipal Bond Funds\\t3\\tProspectus dated June 1, 2018\\n \\nthan 50% of its net assets in municipal obligations rated A at the time of purchase by S&P, Fitch or Moody\\u2019s or, if unrated, determined by the investment adviser to be of comparable quality. For purposes of rating restrictions, if securities are rated differently by two or more rating agencies, the highest rating is used. The Fund may continue to hold securities that are downgraded (including bonds downgraded to below investment grade credit quality (\\u201cjunk bonds\\u201d)) if the investment adviser believes it would be advantageous to do so. The Fund will not invest in a municipal obligation the interest on which the Fund\\u2019s investment adviser believes is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.\\n\\nFor its investment in municipal obligations, the Fund invests primarily in general obligation or revenue bonds. The Fund currently targets an average portfolio duration of approximately 2 - 4.5 years and an average weighted portfolio maturity of approximately 3 - 6 years, but may invest in securities of any maturity or duration, and may in the future alter its maturity or duration target range. The Fund may use various techniques to shorten or lengthen its dollar-weighted average portfolio duration, including the acquisition of municipal obligations at a premium or discount. The portfolio managers generally will seek to enhance after-tax total return by actively engaging in relative value trading within the portfolio to take advantage of price opportunities in the markets for municipal obligations. With respect to 20% of its net assets, the Fund may invest in municipal obligations that are not exempt from regular federal income tax, direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury and/or obligations of U.S. Government agencies, instrumentalities and government-sponsored enterprises. The Fund may also invest in cash and money market instruments.\\n\\nThe investment adviser\\u2019s process for selecting municipal obligations for purchase and sale generally includes consideration of the creditworthiness of the issuer or person obligated to repay the obligation. In evaluating creditworthiness, the investment adviser considers ratings assigned by rating agencies and generally performs additional credit and investment analysis.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nMarket Risk. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic, political and financial events (whether real, expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. The frequency and magnitude of such changes in value cannot be predicted. Certain securities and other investments held by the Fund may experience increased volatility, illiquidity, or other potentially adverse effects in reaction to changing market conditions. Actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve or foreign central banks to stimulate or stabilize economic growth, such as decreases or increases in short-term interest rates, could cause high volatility in markets. No active trading market may exist for certain investments, which may impair the ability of the Fund to sell or to realize the current valuation of such investments in the event of the need to liquidate such assets. Fixed-income markets may experience periods of relatively high volatility in an environment where U.S. treasury yields are rising.\\n\\nMunicipal Obligation Risk. The amount of public information available about municipal obligations is generally less than for corporate equities or bonds, meaning that the investment performance of municipal obligations may be more dependent on the analytical abilities of the investment adviser than stock or corporate bond investments. The secondary market for municipal obligations also tends to be less well-developed and less liquid than many other securities markets, which may limit the Fund\\u2019s ability to sell its municipal obligations at attractive prices. The differences between the price at which an obligation can be purchased and the price at which it can be sold may widen during periods of market distress. Less liquid obligations can become more difficult to value and be subject to erratic price movements. The increased presence of nontraditional participants (such as proprietary trading desks of investment banks and hedge funds) or the absence of traditional participants (such as individuals, insurance companies, banks and life insurance companies) in the municipal markets may lead to greater volatility in the markets because non-traditional participants may trade more frequently or in greater volume. \\n\\nInterest Rate Risk. In general, the value of income securities will fluctuate based on changes in interest rates. The value of these securities is likely to increase when interest rates fall and decline when interest rates rise. Generally, securities with longer durations are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than shorter duration securities, causing them to be more volatile. Conversely, fixed income securities with shorter durations will be less volatile but may provide lower returns than fixed income securities with longer durations. The Fund may own individual investments that have longer durations. In a rising interest rate environment, the durations of income securities that have the ability to be prepaid or called by the issuer may be extended. In a declining interest rate environment, the proceeds from prepaid or maturing instruments may have to be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\\n\\nCredit Risk. Investments in municipal obligations and other debt obligations (referred to below as \\u201cdebt instruments\\u201d) are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled principal and interest. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may reduce the capacity of the party obligated to make principal and interest payments on such instruments and may lead to defaults. Such non-payments and defaults may reduce the value of Fund shares and income distributions. The value of debt instruments also may decline because of concerns about the issuer\\u2019s ability to make principal and interest payments. In addition, the credit ratings of debt instruments may be lowered if the financial condition of the party obligated to make payments with respect to such instruments deteriorates. In order to enforce its rights in the\\n\\nEaton Vance TABS Municipal Bond Funds\\t4\\tProspectus dated June 1, 2018\\n \\nevent of a default, bankruptcy or similar situation, the Fund may be required to retain legal or similar counsel, which may increase the Fund\\u2019s operating expenses and adversely affect net asset value. Municipal obligations may be insured as to principal and interest payments. If the claims-paying ability or other rating of the insurer is downgraded by a rating agency, the value of such obligations may be negatively affected.\\n\\nRisks of Principal Only Investments. Principal only investments entitle the Fund to receive the stated value of such investment when held to maturity. The values of principal only investments are subject to greater fluctuation in response to changes in market interest rates than obligations that pay interest currently. The Fund will accrue income on these investments and distribute that income each year. The Fund may be required to sell other investments to obtain cash needed for such income distributions.\\n\\nU.S. Government Securities Risk. Although certain U.S. Government-sponsored agencies (such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association) may be chartered or sponsored by acts of Congress, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. U.S. Treasury securities generally have a lower return than other obligations because of their higher credit quality and market liquidity.\\n\\nTax Risk. Income from tax-exempt municipal obligations could be declared taxable because of changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the relevant taxing authority or the non-compliant conduct of the issuer of an obligation.\\n\\nMoney Market Instrument Risk. Money market instruments may be adversely affected by market and economic events, such as a sharp rise in prevailing short-term interest rates; adverse developments in the banking industry, which issues or guarantees many money market instruments; adverse economic, political or other developments affecting issuers of money market instruments; changes in the credit quality of issuers; and default by a counterparty.\\n\\nGeneral Fund Investing Risks. The Fund is not a complete investment program and there is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. It is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The Fund is designed to be a long-term investment vehicle and is not suited for short-term trading. Investors in the Fund should have a long-term investment perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value. Purchase and redemption activities by Fund shareholders may impact the management of the Fund and its ability to achieve its investment objective(s). In addition, the redemption by one or more large shareholders or groups of shareholders of their holdings in the Fund could have an adverse impact on the remaining shareholders in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund\\u2019s performance from year to year and how the Fund\\u2019s average annual returns over time compare with those of two broad-based securities market indices.\\n\\nThe Fund commenced operations on March 27, 2009 and is the successor to the operations of a private limited partnership (the \\u201cPredecessor Account\\u201d). The Predecessor Account was managed by Eaton Vance and had substantially the same investment objective, policies and strategies as the Fund. However, the Predecessor Account was not a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \\u201c1940 Act\\u201d) or a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \\u201cCode\\u201d), and therefore the Predecessor Account was not subject to the investment limitations, diversification requirements and other restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act and/or the Code. If such requirements were applicable to the Predecessor Account, the performance shown may have been adversely affected.\\n\\nEaton Vance TABS Municipal Bond Funds\\t5\\tProspectus dated June 1, 2018\\n \\n \\n\\nThe performance of each Class for the period prior to March 27, 2009 is that of the Predecessor Account. The returns in the bar chart for periods after March 27, 2009 are for Class A shares of the Fund and do not reflect a sales charge. If the sales charge was reflected, the returns would be lower. The Fund\\u2019s performance for certain periods after March 27, 2009 reflects the effects of expense reductions. Absent these reductions, performance for certain periods would have been lower. Effective February 17, 2015, the Fund changed its name, objective and investment strategy to invest at least 80% of its net assets in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations, the interest on which is exempt from regular federal income tax. Past performance (both before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated Fund performance information can be obtained by visiting www.eatonvance.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the ten years ended December 31, 2017, the highest quarterly total return for the Fund or Predecessor Account was 5.03% for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and the lowest quarterly return for the Fund or Predecessor Account was -2.36% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The year-to-date total return through the end of the most recent calendar quarter (December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018) was -0.99%.\\n\\nAverage Annual Total Return as of December 31, 2017\\tOne Year\\tFive Years\\tTen Years\\nClass A Return Before Taxes\\t-0.26%\\t0.45%\\t2.45%\\nClass A Return After Taxes on Distributions\\t-0.30%\\t0.34%\\t---\\nClass A Return After Taxes on Distributions and the Sale of Class A Shares\\t0.40%\\t0.56%\\t---\\nClass C Return Before Taxes\\t0.21%\\t0.14%\\t2.01%\\nClass I Return Before Taxes\\t2.32%\\t1.14%\\t2.90%\\nBloomberg  Barclays  5 Year Municipal Bond Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)\\t3.14%\\t1.83%\\t3.54%\\nBloomberg Barclays Municipal Managed Money 1-7 Year Bond Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)\\t2.41%\\t1.38%\\t2.98%\\nThese returns reflect the maximum sales charge for Class A (2.25%) and any applicable contingent deferred sales charge (\\u201cCDSC\\u201d) for Class C. The performance shown above for each Class for the period prior to March 27, 2009 (commencement of operations) is that of the Predecessor Account adjusted to reflect any applicable sales charge or CDSC of the Class but not adjusted for any other differences in expenses. If adjusted for such differences, returns would be different. Investors cannot invest directly in an Index.\\n\\nAfter-Tax Return is calculated using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates and does not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder\\u2019s tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions, and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-deferred accounts or to shares held by non-taxable entities. After-tax returns for other Classes of shares will vary from the after-tax returns presented for Class A shares. Return After Taxes on Distributions for a period may be the same as Return Before Taxes for that period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Also, Return After Taxes on distributions and Sale of Fund Shares for a period may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares. After-Tax Returns are not shown for the Ten Years ending December 31, 2017 because the Predecessor Account, unlike a registered investment company, was not required to make annual income distributions to its investors.\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nInvestment Adviser.

It illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you were to invest $10,000 in the Fund\\u2019s shares. This example assumes that the Fund provides a return of 5% each year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table. You would incur these hypothetical expenses whether or not you redeem your investment at the end of the given period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\n$8\\t$26\\t$45\\t$103\\n \\n\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the fiscal period from September 26, 2017, to January 31, 2018, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 1% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Transition Index, an interim index that will gradually increase exposure to other real estate-related investments while proportionately reducing exposure to other stocks based on their weightings in the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index. The MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index is made up of stocks of large, mid-size, and small U.S. companies within the real estate sector, as classified under the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). The GICS real estate sector is composed of equity real estate investment trusts (known as REITs), which includes specialized REITs, and real estate management and development companies.\\n\\nThe Fund attempts to replicate the Index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.\\n\\n2\\n\\n \\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Industry concentration risk, which is the chance that the stocks of REITs and other real estate-related investments will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. Because the Fund concentrates its assets in these stocks, industry concentration risk is high.\\n\\n\\u2022 Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund\\u2019s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a limited number of companies, which could cause the Fund to underperform the overall stock market.\\n\\n\\u2022 Interest rate risk, which is the chance that REIT stock prices overall will decline and that the cost of borrowing for REITs will increase because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk is high for the Fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Investment style risk, which is the chance that the returns from the stocks of REITs and other real estate-related investments\\u2014which typically are small- or mid-capitalization stocks\\u2014will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, these stocks have performed quite differently from the overall market.\\n\\n\\u2022 Nondiversification risk, which is the chance that the Fund may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a particular issuer or group of issuers or may own larger positions of an issuer\\u2019s voting stock than a diversified fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Asset concentration risk, which is the chance that, because the Fund\\u2019s target index (and therefore the Fund) tends to be heavily weighted in its ten largest holdings, the Fund\\u2019s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe Fund has not been in operation long enough to report a full calendar-year return. Performance information is available on our website at vanguard.com/performance or by calling Vanguard toll-free at 800-662-7447.\\n\\n3\\n\\n \\n\\nInvestment Advisor\\nThe Vanguard Group, Inc.

He has co-managed the Fund since its inception in 2017.\\n\\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares\\n\\nYou may purchase or redeem shares online through our website (vanguard.com), by mail (The Vanguard Group, P.O. Box 1110, Valley Forge, PA 19482-1110), or by telephone (800-662-2739). The minimum investment amount required to open and maintain a Fund account for Institutional Plus Shares is $100 million. The minimum investment amount required to add to an existing Fund account is generally $1.\\n\\nTax Information\\n\\nThe Fund\\u2019s distributions may be taxable as ordinary income or capital gain or may constitute non-taxable return of capital. If you are investing through a tax-advantaged account, special tax rules apply.\\n\\nPayments to Financial Intermediaries\\n\\nThe Fund and its investment advisor do not pay financial intermediaries for sales of Fund shares.\",\n          \"Growth Fund\\n\\nInvestment objective The fund\\u2019s investment objective is to provide growth of capital.\\n\\nFees and expenses of the fund This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold an interest in Class 1 shares of the fund. It does not reflect insurance contract fees and expenses.

The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. The example does not reflect insurance contract expenses. If insurance contract expenses were reflected, expenses shown would be higher. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\t \\t \\t \\t \\n \\t1 year\\t3 years\\t5 years\\t10 years\\nClass 1\\t$36\\t$113\\t$197\\t$443\\nPortfolio turnover The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 24% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund invests primarily in common stocks and seeks to invest in companies that appear to offer superior opportunities for growth of capital. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in common stocks and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\nThe investment adviser uses a system of multiple portfolio managers in managing the fund\\u2019s assets. Under this approach, the portfolio of the fund is divided into segments managed by individual managers who decide how their respective segments will be invested.\\n\\nThe fund relies on the professional judgment of its investment adviser to make decisions about the fund\\u2019s portfolio investments. The basic investment philosophy of the investment adviser is to seek to invest in attractively valued companies that, in its opinion, represent good, long-term investment opportunities. The investment adviser believes that an important way to accomplish this is through fundamental analysis, which may include meeting with company executives and employees, suppliers, customers and competitors. Securities may be sold when the investment adviser believes that they no longer represent relatively attractive investment opportunities.\\n\\n7     American Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPrincipal risks\\n\\nThis section describes the principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s principal investment strategies. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks and other securities held by the fund may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental or governmental agency responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the fund may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nInvesting in growth-oriented stocks \\u2014 Growth-oriented common stocks and other equity-type securities (such as preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks and convertible bonds) may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments. These risks may be even greater in the case of smaller capitalization stocks.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, that could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by the fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund actively manages the fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the fund is subject to the risk that the methods and analyses employed by the investment adviser in this process may not produce the desired results. This could cause the fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. You should consider how this fund fits into your overall investment program.\\n\\nAmerican Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus     8\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvestment results The following bar chart shows how the investment results of the Class 1 shares of the fund have varied from year to year, and the following table shows how the fund\\u2019s average annual total returns for various periods compare with a broad measure of securities market results and other applicable measures of market results.

These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your individual financial advisor to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your individual financial advisor or visit your financial intermediary\\u2019s website for more information. The fund is not sold directly to the general public but instead is offered as an underlying investment option for variable insurance contracts. In addition to payments described above, the fund and its related companies may make payments to the sponsoring insurance company (or its affiliates) for distribution and/or other services. These payments may be a factor that the insurance company considers in including the fund as an underlying investment option in the variable insurance contract. The prospectus (or other offering document) for your variable insurance contract may contain additional information about these payments.GROWTH FUND\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"strategy_sentences_distance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 245,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The fund's portfolio managers focus on identifying undervalued government bond markets, currencies, sectors and securities and look for fixed-income securities with the most potential for added value.

The example assumes that you are not participating in the Fidelity\\u00ae systematic withdrawal plan.\\n\\nLet's say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that your shareholder fees and the annual operating expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated:\\n\\n1 year \\t$48 \\n3 years \\t$149 \\n5 years \\t$260 \\n10 years \\t$585 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe fund will not incur transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells shares of underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio), but it could incur transaction costs if it were to buy and sell other types of securities directly. If the fund were to buy and sell other types of securities directly, a higher portfolio turnover rate could indicate higher transaction costs and could result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. Such costs, if incurred, would not be reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example and would affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 46% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nInvesting primarily in a combination of Fidelity\\u00ae domestic equity funds, international equity funds, bond funds, and short-term funds (underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds) to seek to achieve the fund's investment objective consistent with a payment strategy to be administered through a complementary systematic withdrawal plan.\\nAllocating assets according to a stable neutral asset allocation strategy shown in the glide path below. FMR Co., Inc. (the Adviser) may modify the fund\\u2019s neutral asset allocations from time to time when in the interests of shareholders.\\nBuying and selling futures contracts (both long and short positions) in an effort to manage cash flows efficiently, remain fully invested, or facilitate asset allocation.\\n\\nAllocating assets among underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds and futures according to a stable neutral asset allocation of approximately:\\n   \\tDomestic Equity Funds* \\t17% \\n   \\tInternational Equity Funds* \\t7% \\n   \\tBond Funds* \\t46% \\n   \\tShort-Term Funds* \\t30% \\n\\n* The Adviser may change these percentages over time. As a result of the active asset allocation strategy (discussed below), actual allocations may differ from the neutral allocations above.\\n\\nThe Adviser may use an active asset allocation strategy to increase or decrease neutral asset class exposures reflected above by up to 10% for equity funds, bond funds and short-term funds to reflect the Adviser's market outlook, which is primarily focused on the intermediate term. The asset allocations in the glide path and pie chart above are referred to as neutral because they do not reflect any decisions made by the Adviser to overweight or underweight an asset class.\\nThe fund's investment objective is intended to support a payment strategy designed to be implemented through a shareholder's voluntary participation in a complementary systematic withdrawal plan that will enable shareholders to receive regular payments from the fund based on their expected required minimum distributions from certain types of retirement accounts as mandated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). However, shareholders may invest in the fund and not participate in the plan.\\n\\nInvestors should refer to the \\\"Features and Policies\\\" section of the prospectus for a summary of how the payment strategy and plan are designed to operate.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nThe fund is designed for investors who seek to convert accumulated assets into regular payments over time. A shareholder's participation in the systematic withdrawal plan will result in the gradual withdrawal of the value of the shareholder's account in the fund. The fund's share price fluctuates, which means you could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nAsset Allocation Risk.  The fund is subject to risks resulting from the Adviser's asset allocation decisions. If FMRC's asset allocation strategy does not work as intended, the fund may not achieve its objective. If the fund is unable to achieve its objective, the payment strategy may not work as intended. The selection of underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among various asset classes could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives. In addition, the fund's active asset allocation strategy may cause the fund to have a risk profile different than that portrayed above from time to time and may increase losses.\\nInvesting in Other Funds.  The fund bears all risks of investment strategies employed by the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives.\\nStock Market Volatility.  Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Different parts of the market, including different market sectors, and different types of securities can react differently to these developments.\\nInterest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt or money market security to decrease.\\nForeign Exposure.  Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, can be more volatile than the U.S. market due to increased risks of adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can perform differently from the U.S. market.\\nIndustry Exposure.  Market conditions, interest rates, and economic, regulatory, or financial developments could significantly affect a single industry or group of related industries.\\nPrepayment.  The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security's maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest rates change.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease. Lower-quality debt securities (those of less than investment-grade quality, also referred to as high yield debt securities or junk bonds) and certain types of other securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality of the issuer. The value of lower-quality debt securities and certain types of other securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.\\nCorrelation to Index.  The performance of an underlying index fund and its index may vary somewhat due to factors such as fees and expenses of the underlying fund, transaction costs, sample selection, regulatory restrictions, and timing differences associated with additions to and deletions from the index.\\nPassive Management Risk.  An underlying fund is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of an underlying fund's index or of the actual securities included in the index. This differs from an actively managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, an underlying fund's performance could be lower than actively managed funds that may shift their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers.\\nLeverage Risk.  Leverage can increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly.\\nInflation-Protected Debt Exposure.  Increases in real interest rates can cause the price of inflation-protected debt securities to decrease. Interest payments on inflation-protected debt securities can be unpredictable.\\nCommodity-Linked Investing.  The value of commodities and commodity-linked investments may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as weather, political, tax, and other regulatory and market developments. Commodity-linked investments may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying commodity, instruments, or measures.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund. The information illustrates the changes in the performance of the fund's shares from year to year and compares the performance of the fund's shares to the performance of a securities market index and an additional index over various periods of time. The indexes have characteristics relevant to the fund's investment strategies. Index descriptions appear in the \\\"Additional Index Information\\\" section of the prospectus. Prior to June 1, 2017, the fund operated under certain different investment policies and a different pricing structure. The fund's historical performance prior to June 1, 2017 may not represent its current investment policies and does not reflect the fund's current pricing structure. Past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future performance.\\n\\nVisit www.fidelity.com for more recent performance information.\\n\\nYear-by-Year Returns\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the periods shown in the chart: \\tReturns \\tQuarter ended \\nHighest Quarter Return \\t12.56% \\tJune 30, 2009 \\nLowest Quarter Return \\t(13.28)% \\tDecember 31, 2008 \\nYear-to-Date Return \\t(0.34)% \\tJune 30, 2018 \\nAverage Annual Returns\\n\\nAfter-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates, but do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes.

The target date is meant to roughly correspond to the year in which the fund beneficiary will start to withdraw funds to meet higher education expenses. The fund will increasingly emphasize income and preservation of capital by investing a greater portion of its assets in bond, equity-income and balanced funds as it approaches and passes its target date. In this way, the fund seeks to achieve an appropriate balance of total return and stability during different time periods.\\n\\nFees and expenses of the fund This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. You may qualify for a Class 529-A sales charge discount if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $100,000 in American Funds.

The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\nShare class:\\t529-A\\t529-C\\t529-E\\t529-T\\t529-F-1\\tFor the share class listed to the right, you would pay the following if you did not redeem your shares:\\tShare class:\\t529-C\\n1 year\\t$ 498\\t$ 254\\t$ 100\\t$ 332\\t$ 52\\t1 year\\t$ 154\\n3 years\\t654\\t477\\t312\\t505\\t164\\t3 years\\t477\\n5 years\\t824\\t824\\t542\\t694\\t285\\t5 years\\t824\\n10 years\\t1,316\\t1,802\\t1,201\\t1,238\\t640\\t10 years\\t1,802\\nPortfolio turnover The fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 10% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund will attempt to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a mix of American Funds in different combinations and weightings. The underlying American Funds represent a variety of fund categories such as growth funds, growth-and-income funds, equity-income funds, balanced funds and bond funds. The fund categories represent differing investment objectives. For example, growth funds seek long-term growth primarily through investing in both U.S. stocks and stocks of issuers domiciled outside the U.S. Growth-and-income funds seek long-term growth-and-income primarily through investments in stocks. Equity-income and balanced funds generally strive for income and growth through stocks and/or bond investments, while bond funds seek current income through bond investments. The fund is designed for investors who plan to attend college in, or close to, the year designated in the fund\\u2019s name.\\n\\nThe investment adviser may periodically rebalance or modify the asset mix of the funds and change the underlying fund investments. According to its current investment approach, the percentage of the fund invested in different categories will change until the fund reaches its target date. Upon reaching its target date, the fund will be principally invested in fixed-income funds and may merge into the Enrollment Fund, which will also be principally invested in fixed-income funds.\\n\\nThe fund\\u2019s investment adviser periodically reviews the investment strategies and asset mix of the underlying funds. The investment adviser will also consider whether overall market conditions would favor a change in the exposure of the fund to various asset types or geographic regions. Based on these considerations, the investment adviser may make adjustments to underlying fund holdings by adjusting the percentage of individual underlying funds within the fund, or adding or removing underlying funds. The investment adviser may also determine not to change the underlying fund allocations, particularly in response to short-term market movements, if in its opinion the combination of underlying funds is appropriate to meet the fund\\u2019s investment objective.\\n\\nWith respect to its fixed-income investments, the underlying funds in which the fund invests may hold debt securities with a wide range of quality and maturities. The fund may invest in underlying funds with significant exposure to bonds rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser, or unrated but determined by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser to be of equivalent quality. Securities rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below are sometimes referred to as \\u201cjunk bonds.\\u201d Exposure to lower rated securities may help the fund achieve its objective of providing current income.\\n\\nThe underlying funds may hold securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government, securities issued by federal agencies and instrumentalities and securities backed by mortgages or other assets. The underlying funds may also invest in the debt securities of governments, agencies, corporations and other entities domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\n23     American Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nThe following chart illustrates the investment approach of the fund by showing how its investment in the various fund categories will change over time. The allocations shown reflect the fund\\u2019s target allocations as of January 1, 2019.\\n\\nInvestment approach\\n\\n\\n\\nThe investment adviser anticipates that the fund will invest its assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below the investment approach set forth above. For example, a 20% target allocation to growth funds is not expected to be greater than 30% or less than 10%. The investment adviser will continuously monitor the fund and may make modifications to either the investment approach or the underlying fund allocations that the investment adviser believes could benefit shareholders.\\n\\nPrincipal risks This section describes the principal risks associated with investing in the fund and its underlying funds. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s investment strategies.\\n\\nAllocation risk \\u2014 Investments in the fund are subject to risks related to the investment adviser\\u2019s allocation choices. The selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund\\u2019s assets could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nFund structure \\u2014 The fund invests in underlying funds and incurs expenses related to the underlying funds. In addition, investors in the fund will incur fees to pay for certain expenses related to the operations of the fund. An investor holding the underlying funds directly and in the same proportions as the fund would incur lower overall expenses but would not receive the benefit of the portfolio management and other services provided by the fund.\\n\\nUnderlying fund risks \\u2014 Because the fund\\u2019s investments consist of underlying funds, the fund\\u2019s risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. For this reason, it is important to understand the risks associated with investing in the underlying funds, as described below.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the underlying funds\\u2019 investment strategies.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks, bonds and other securities held by the underlying funds may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental, governmental agency or central bank responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the underlying funds may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance, major litigation against the issuer, changes in government regulations affecting the issuer or its competitive environment and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nAmerican Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus     24\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in stocks \\u2014 Investing in stocks may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments. As a result, the value of the underlying funds may be subject to sharp, short-term declines in value. Income provided by an underlying fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available at, the companies in which the underlying fund invests. As the fund nears its target date, a decreasing proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will be invested in underlying funds that invest primarily in stocks. Accordingly, these risks are expected to be more significant the further the fund is removed from its target date and are expected to lessen as the fund approaches its target date.\\n\\nInvesting in debt instruments \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, bonds and other debt securities held by an underlying fund may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the effective maturities and credit ratings of these securities.\\n\\nRising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. A general rise in interest rates may cause investors to sell debt securities on a large scale, which could also adversely affect the price and liquidity of debt securities and could also result in increased redemptions from the fund. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund failing to recoup the full amount of its initial investment and having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities generally have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter maturity debt securities.\\n\\nBonds and other debt securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer or guarantor will weaken or be perceived to be weaker, and/or an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default. A downgrade or default affecting any of the underlying funds\\u2019 securities could cause the value of the underlying funds\\u2019 shares to decrease. Credit risk is gauged, in part, by the credit ratings of the debt securities in which the underlying fund invests. However, ratings are only the opinions of the rating agencies issuing them and are not guarantees as to credit quality or an evaluation of market risk. The underlying funds\\u2019 investment adviser relies on its own credit analysts to research issuers and issues in seeking to assess credit and default risks. These risks will be more significant as the fund approaches its target date because a greater proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will consist of underlying funds that primarily invest in bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in lower rated debt instruments \\u2014 Lower rated bonds and other lower rated debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuer\\u2019s creditworthiness than those of higher quality debt securities. The market prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of higher quality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. These risks may be increased with respect to investments in junk bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in small companies \\u2014 Investing in smaller companies may pose additional risks. For example, it is often more difficult to value or dispose of small company stocks and more difficult to obtain information about smaller companies than about larger companies. Furthermore, smaller companies often have limited product lines, operating histories, markets and/or financial resources, may be dependent on one or a few key persons for management, and can be more susceptible to losses. Moreover, the prices of their stocks may be more volatile than stocks of larger, more established companies, particularly during times of market turmoil.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as nationalization, currency blockage or the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, each of which could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by an underlying fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\n25     American Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in emerging markets \\u2014 Investing in emerging markets may involve risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in the securities markets of developed countries. For instance, emerging market countries may have less developed legal and accounting systems than those in developed countries. The governments of these countries may be less stable and more likely to impose capital controls, nationalize a company or industry, place restrictions on foreign ownership and on withdrawing sale proceeds of securities from the country, and/or impose punitive taxes that could adversely affect the prices of securities. In addition, the economies of these countries may be dependent on relatively few industries that are more susceptible to local and global changes. Securities markets in these countries can also be relatively small and have substantially lower trading volumes. As a result, securities issued in these countries may be more volatile and less liquid, and may be more difficult to value, than securities issued in countries with more developed economies and/or markets. Less certainty with respect to security valuations may lead to additional challenges and risks in calculating the underlying fund\\u2019s net asset value. Additionally, emerging markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades and the holding of securities by banks, agents and depositories that are less established than those in developed countries.\\n\\nInvesting in derivatives \\u2014 The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and a derivative instrument may expose the underlying fund to losses in excess of its initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult to value, difficult for the underlying fund to buy or sell at an opportune time or price and difficult to terminate or otherwise offset. The underlying fund\\u2019s use of derivatives may result in losses to the underlying fund, and investing in derivatives may reduce the underlying fund\\u2019s returns and increase the underlying fund\\u2019s price volatility. The underlying fund\\u2019s counterparty to a derivative transaction (including, if applicable, the underlying fund\\u2019s clearing broker, the derivatives exchange or the clearinghouse) may be unable or unwilling to honor its financial obligations in respect of the transaction.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund and to the underlying funds actively manages each underlying fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the underlying funds are subject to the risk that the methods and analyses, including models, tools and data, employed by the investment adviser in this process may be flawed or incorrect and may not produce the desired results. This could cause an underlying fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person.

The municipal market is volatile and can be significantly affected by adverse tax, legislative, or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities.\\nInterest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt security to decrease.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease.\\nDeclining Yield Risk.  As the fund approaches its liquidation date, the fund's securities will mature and the fund may reinvest the proceeds in money market securities with lower yields than the securities previously held by the fund.\\nFluctuation of Yield & Liquidation Amount Risk.  The amount of the fund's income distributions will vary over time, and the breakdown of returns between fund distributions and liquidation proceeds will not be predictable at the time of your investment, and you may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Unlike individual debt securities, which typically pay principal at maturity, the value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. You could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund. The information illustrates the changes in the performance of the fund's shares from year to year and compares the performance of the fund's shares to the performance of a securities market index and an additional index over various periods of time. The indexes have characteristics relevant to the fund's investment strategies. Index descriptions appear in the \\\"Additional Index Information\\\" section of the prospectus. Past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future performance.\\n\\nVisit institutional.fidelity.com for more recent performance information.\\n\\nYear-by-Year Returns\\n\\nThe returns in the bar chart do not reflect any applicable sales charges; if sales charges were reflected, returns would be lower than those shown.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the periods shown in the chart for Class A: \\tReturns \\tQuarter ended \\nHighest Quarter Return \\t3.65% \\tMarch 31, 2014 \\nLowest Quarter Return \\t(4.66)% \\tDecember 31, 2016 \\nYear-to-Date Return \\t(0.31)% \\tJune 30, 2018 \\nAverage Annual Returns\\n\\nUnlike the returns in the bar chart, the returns in the table reflect the maximum applicable sales charges. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates, but do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. After-tax returns for Class A are shown in the table below and after-tax returns for other classes will vary. Actual after-tax returns may differ depending on your individual circumstances. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares may be higher than other returns for the same period due to a tax benefit of realizing a capital loss upon the sale of fund shares.\\n\\nFor the periods ended December 31, 2017 \\tPast 1 year \\tLife of class(a) \\nClass A - Return Before Taxes \\t1.27% \\t1.71% \\nReturn After Taxes on Distributions \\t1.27% \\t1.70% \\nReturn After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares \\t1.49% \\t1.73% \\nClass I - Return Before Taxes \\t4.39% \\t2.57% \\nBloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index\\n(reflects no deduction for fees, expenses, or taxes) \\t5.45% \\t2.97% \\nBloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond 2023 Index Ex Tobacco/Prepaid Gas\\n(reflects no deduction for fees, expenses, or taxes) \\t4.32% \\t2.35% \\n(a)  From April 23, 2013\\n\\nInvestment Adviser\\n\\nFMR (the Adviser) is the fund's manager.

Income exempt from federal income tax may be subject to state or local tax. A portion of the dividends you receive may be subject to federal and state income taxes and may also be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. You may also receive taxable distributions attributable to the fund's sale of municipal bonds.\\n\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries\\n\\nThe fund, the Adviser, Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), and/or their affiliates may pay intermediaries, which may include banks, broker-dealers, retirement plan sponsors, administrators, or service-providers (who may be affiliated with the Adviser or FDC), for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing your intermediary and your investment professional to recommend the fund over another investment.

Please see \\u201cSales Charge Waiver Policies Applied by Certain Intermediaries\\u201d in the \\u201cAppendix\\u201d section of the prospectus. In addition to the fees and expenses described below, your broker may also require you to pay brokerage commissions on purchases and sales of certain share classes of the fund. Fee Table\\n\\nThe following table describes the fees and expenses that may be incurred when you buy and hold shares of the fund.\",\n          \"Equity-income and balanced funds generally strive for income and growth through stocks and/or bond investments, while bond funds seek current income through bond investments. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as nationalization, currency blockage or the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, each of which could adversely impact the value of these securities. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund failing to recoup the full amount of its initial investment and having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Securities rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below are sometimes referred to as \\u201cjunk bonds.\\u201d Exposure to lower rated securities may help the fund achieve its objective of providing current income. The selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund\\u2019s assets could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\",\n          \"Therefore, the investment manager would not necessarily buy or sell a security unless that security is added or removed, respectively, from the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index, even if that security generally is underperforming. In addition, the Fund\\u2019s NAV may deviate from the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index if the Fund fair values a portfolio security at a price other than the price used by the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index for that security.

Currency Hedging   In seeking investment results that closely correspond, before fees and expenses, to the performance of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index, the Fund will attempt to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio by investing in foreign currency forward contracts and/or currency futures contracts. No adjustment to the hedge is made during the month to account for changes in the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index due to price movement of securities, corporate events, additions, deletions or any other changes (i.e., the amount hedged is kept constant over the whole month).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Other expenses of the Fund have been restated to exclude non-recurring prior period expenses and to reflect current fiscal year expenses. If the non-recurring prior period expenses were included in the table above, the amount stated would have been greater. Consequently, the total annual Fund operating expenses differ from the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the Financial Highlights.\\n\\n2. The investment manager has contractually agreed to waive or assume certain fees and expenses so that total annual Fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses and certain non-routine expenses) for each class of the Fund do not exceed 0.44% until September 30, 2019. The investment manager also has contractually agreed in advance to reduce its fees as a result of the Fund's investment in a Franklin Templeton money fund (acquired fund) for the next 12-month period. The Fund\\u2019s fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements have been restated to reflect current fiscal year information. Consequently, total annual Fund operating expenses after fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements differ from the ratio of expenses to average net assets net of waiver and payments shown in the Financial Highlights. Contractual fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement agreements may not be changed or terminated during the time period set forth above.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nThis Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of the period. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. The Example reflects adjustments made to the Fund's operating expenses due to the fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by management for the 1 Year numbers only. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n   \\t1 Year \\t3 Years \\nClass R6   \\t$ 30 \\t$ 708 \\nAdvisor Class   \\t$ 45 \\t$ 753 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual Fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. For the period January 23, 2018 through May 31, 2018, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 0.00% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund invests predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated investment grade debt securities and investments, including government and corporate debt securities and asset-backed securities and municipal securities. Such securities may be fixed or variable rate. Asset-backed securities are securities backed by loans, leases, and other receivables.\\n\\nAlthough the Fund may invest in individual securities of any maturity, the Fund is a term fund and is managed to mature in the year indicated in its name. Over time, the Fund\\u2019s duration and weighted average maturity will decline as its maturity date approaches. In the later months of operation, when the debt securities held by the Fund mature, the proceeds from such securities will be held in cash, cash equivalents and money market instruments, including affiliated money market funds, or invested in short-term bonds. In early December of the year indicated in the Fund\\u2019s name, the Fund is expected to consist almost entirely of cash, cash equivalents and money market instruments.\\n\\nThe Fund will terminate in early December of the year specified in its name. At that time, the Fund will make a cash distribution to then-current shareholders of its net assets after making appropriate provisions for any liabilities of the Fund. The Board may change the termination date to an earlier or later date without shareholder approval if the Board determines the change is in the best interests of Fund shareholders.\\n\\nThe Fund focuses on investment grade securities and investments or in unrated securities and investments the investment manager determines are of comparable quality. The Fund\\u2019s focus on the credit quality of its portfolio is intended to reduce credit risk and help to preserve its capital. The Fund may invest a significant portion of its total assets in U.S. dollar denominated foreign securities, including debt issued by supranational entities.\\n\\nIn choosing investments, the Fund\\u2019s investment manager selects securities in various market sectors based on the investment manager\\u2019s assessment of changing economic, market, industry and issuer conditions. The investment manager uses a \\u201ctop-down\\u201d analysis of macroeconomic trends, combined with a \\u201cbottom-up\\u201d fundamental analysis of market sectors, industries and issuers, to try to take advantage of varying sector reactions to economic events.\\n\\nThe Fund is not designed for long-term capital appreciation and does not provide a complete solution for a shareholder\\u2019s retirement income needs. Shareholders should consider other factors besides their age or retirement date, such as their risk tolerance, personal circumstances, and complete financial situation, before investing in the Fund. It is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund, including at its target maturity date. The Fund does not guarantee a level of dividends, income or principal at or before its target maturity date.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nYou could lose money by investing in the Fund. Mutual fund shares are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank, and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other agency of the U.S. government.\\n\\nCredit   An issuer of debt securities may fail to make interest payments or repay principal when due, in whole or in part. Changes in an issuer's financial strength or in a security's credit rating may affect a security's value.\\n\\nInterest Rate   When interest rates rise, debt security prices generally fall. The opposite is also generally true: debt security prices rise when interest rates fall. Interest rate changes are influenced by a number of factors, including government policy, monetary policy, inflation expectations, perceptions of risk, and supply of and demand for bonds. In general, securities with longer maturities or durations are more sensitive to interest rate changes.\\n\\nIncome   The Fund's distributions to shareholders may decline when prevailing interest rates fall, when the Fund experiences defaults on debt securities it holds, or when the Fund realizes a loss upon the sale of a debt security.\\n\\nVariable Rate Securities   Because changes in interest rates on variable rate securities (including floating rate securities) may lag behind changes in market rates, the value of such securities may decline during periods of rising interest rates until their interest rates reset to market rates. During periods of declining interest rates, because the interest rates on variable rate securities generally reset downward, their market value is unlikely to rise to the same extent as the value of comparable fixed rate securities.\\n\\nYield and Liquidation Amount   During the year prior to or in the year of the Fund\\u2019s termination date, the debt securities held by the Fund will mature and the Fund\\u2019s portfolio will transition to cash and cash equivalents, and other short-term fixed income securities. As this occurs, the Fund\\u2019s yield will generally tend to move toward the yield of cash and cash equivalents and may be lower than the yields of the debt securities previously held by the Fund or the prevailing yields for bonds in the market.\\n\\nIn addition, unlike a direct investment in a bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, the Fund will make distributions of income that vary over time. The Fund\\u2019s distributions and liquidation proceeds will not be predictable at the time of your investment.\\n\\nLiquidity   From time to time, the trading market for a particular security or type of security or other investments in which the Fund invests may become less liquid or even illiquid. Reduced liquidity will have an adverse impact on the Fund\\u2019s ability to sell such securities or other investments when necessary to meet the Fund\\u2019s liquidity needs, which may arise or increase in response to a specific economic event or because the investment manager wishes to purchase particular investments or believes that a higher level of liquidity would be advantageous. Reduced liquidity will also generally lower the value of such securities or other investments. Market prices for such securities or other investments may be relatively volatile.\\n\\nForeign Securities (non-U.S.)   Investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in U.S. securities, including risks related to currency exchange rates and policies, country or government specific issues, less favorable trading practices or regulation and greater price volatility. Certain of these risks also may apply to securities of U.S. companies with significant foreign operations.\\n\\nAsset-Backed Securities   Issuers of asset-backed securities may have limited ability to enforce the security interest in the underlying assets, and credit enhancements provided to support the securities, if any, may be inadequate to protect investors in the event of default. Like mortgage securities, asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment and extension risks.\\n\\nMarket   The market values of securities or other investments owned by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The market value of a security or other investment may be reduced by market activity or other results of supply and demand unrelated to the issuer. This is a basic risk associated with all investments. When there are more sellers than buyers, prices tend to fall. Likewise, when there are more buyers than sellers, prices tend to rise.\\n\\nManagement   The Fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed investment portfolio. The Fund's investment manager applies investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Fund, but there can be no guarantee that these decisions will produce the desired results.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nBecause the Fund does not have a full calendar year of performance, annual total return information is not available and therefore is not presented. You can obtain updated performance information by calling (800) 321-8563.\\n\\nInvestment Manager\\n\\nFranklin Advisers, Inc. (Advisers)\\n\\nPortfolio Managers\\n\\nRoger Bayston, CFA   Senior Vice President of Advisers and portfolio manager of the Fund since inception (2015).\\n\\nDavid Yuen, CFA   Portfolio Manager of Advisers and portfolio manager of the Fund since inception (2015).\\n\\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares\\n\\nYou may purchase shares of the Fund on any business day by mail (Franklin Templeton Institutional Services, P.O. Box 33030, St. Petersburg, FL 33733-8030). You may redeem shares of the Fund on any business day by mail at the address listed above, or by telephone at (800) 321-8563. The minimum initial purchase varies depending on the type of investor and could be up to $1,000,000. More information about eligibility to invest in the Fund and the applicable minimum requirements is under \\\"Your Account\\\" in the detail section of the Fund's prospectus. There is no minimum investment for subsequent purchases.\\n\\nTaxes\\n\\nThe Fund's distributions are generally taxable to you as ordinary income, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account, in which case your distributions would generally be taxed when withdrawn from the tax-deferred account.\\n\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and\\nOther Financial Intermediaries\\n\\nIf you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your financial advisor or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\",\n          \"Bond Fund\\n\\nInvestment objective The fund\\u2019s investment objective is to provide as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital.\\n\\nFees and expenses of the fund This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold an interest in Class 1 shares of the fund.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 502% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund seeks to maximize your level of current income and preserve your capital by investing primarily in bonds. Normally, the fund invests at least 80% of its assets in bonds and other debt securities, which may be represented by other investment instruments, including derivatives. The fund invests at least 65% of its assets in investment-grade debt securities (rated Baa3 or better or BBB\\u2013 or better by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, or NRSROs, designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser or unrated but determined to be of equivalent quality by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser), including cash and cash equivalents, securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. and other governments, and securities backed by mortgages and other assets. The fund may invest up to 35% of its assets in debt securities rated Ba1 or below and BB+ or below by NRSROs designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser or unrated but determined by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser to be of equivalent quality. Such securities are sometimes referred to as \\u201cjunk bonds.\\u201d The fund may invest in debt securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, including in emerging markets. The fund may also invest up to 20% of its assets in preferred stocks, including convertible and nonconvertible preferred stocks. In addition, the fund may invest, subject to the restrictions above, in contracts for future delivery of mortgage-backed securities, such as to-be-announced contracts and mortgage rolls. These contracts are normally of short duration and may be replaced by another contract prior to maturity. Each such transaction is reflected as turnover in the fund\\u2019s portfolio, resulting in a higher portfolio turnover rate than funds that do not employ this investment strategy. The fund is designed for investors seeking income and more price stability than stocks, and capital preservation over the long term.\\n\\nThe fund may invest in certain derivative instruments, such as futures contracts and swaps. A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which is based on the value of an underlying financial asset (such as a stock, bond or currency), a reference rate or a market index. The fund may invest in a derivative only if, in the opinion of the investment adviser, the expected risks and rewards of the proposed investment are consistent with the investment objective and strategies of the fund as disclosed in this prospectus and in the fund\\u2019s statement of additional information.\\n\\nThe investment adviser uses a system of multiple portfolio managers in managing the fund\\u2019s assets. Under this approach, the portfolio of the fund is divided into segments managed by individual managers who decide how their respective segments will be invested.\\n\\nThe fund relies on the professional judgment of its investment adviser to make decisions about the fund\\u2019s portfolio investments. The basic investment philosophy of the investment adviser is to seek to invest in attractively priced securities that, in its opinion, represent good, long-term investment opportunities. The investment adviser believes that an important way to accomplish this is through fundamental research, which may include analysis of credit quality, general economic conditions and various quantitative measures and, in the case of corporate obligations, meeting with company executives and employees, suppliers, customers and competitors. Securities may be sold when the investment adviser believes that they no longer represent relatively attractive investment opportunities.\\n\\nAmerican Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus     40\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPrincipal risks\\n\\nThis section describes the principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s principal investment strategies. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the bonds and other securities held by the fund may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental or governmental agency responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the fund may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nInvesting in debt instruments \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, bonds and other debt securities held by the fund may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the effective maturities and credit ratings of these securities.\\n\\nRising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities generally have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter maturity debt securities.\\n\\nBonds and other debt securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer will weaken and/or an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default. Lower quality debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality debt securities. Credit risk is gauged, in part, by the credit ratings of the debt securities in which the fund invests. However, ratings are only the opinions of the rating agencies issuing them and are not guarantees as to credit quality or an evaluation of market risk. The fund\\u2019s investment adviser relies on its own credit analysts to research issuers and issues in seeking to mitigate various credit and default risks.\\n\\nInvesting in lower rated debt instruments \\u2014 Lower rated bonds and other lower rated debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuer\\u2019s creditworthiness than those of higher quality debt securities. The market prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of higher quality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. These risks may be increased with respect to investments in junk bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities \\u2014 Mortgage-related securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities, include debt obligations that represent interests in pools of mortgages or other income-bearing assets, such as consumer loans or receivables. Such securities often involve risks that are different from or more acute than the risks associated with investing in other types of debt securities. Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are subject to changes in the payment patterns of borrowers of the underlying debt. When interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to refinance or prepay their debt before its stated maturity. This may result in the fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities, effectively reducing the fund\\u2019s income. Conversely, if interest rates rise and borrowers repay their debt more slowly than expected, the time in which the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are paid off could be extended, reducing the fund\\u2019s cash available for reinvestment in higher yielding securities.\\n\\n41     American Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in future delivery contracts \\u2014 The fund may enter into contracts, such as to-be-announced contracts and mortgage dollar rolls, that involve the fund selling mortgage-related securities and simultaneously contracting to repurchase similar securities for delivery at a future date at a predetermined price. This can increase the fund\\u2019s market exposure, and the market price of the securities that the fund contracts to repurchase could drop below their purchase price. While the fund can preserve and generate capital through the use of such contracts by, for example, realizing the difference between the sale price and the future purchase price, the income generated by the fund may be reduced by engaging in such transactions. In addition, these transactions may increase the turnover rate of the fund.\\n\\nInvesting in securities backed by the U.S. government \\u2014 Securities backed by the U.S. Treasury or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are guaranteed only as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity. Accordingly, the current market values for these securities will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Securities issued by government-sponsored entities and federal agencies and instrumentalities that are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. government.\\n\\nInvesting in inflation-linked bonds \\u2014 The values of inflation-linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates \\u2014 i.e., rates of interest after factoring in inflation. A rise in real interest rates may cause the prices of inflation-linked securities to fall, while a decline in real interest rates may cause the prices to increase. Inflation-linked bonds may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations when real interest rates rise faster than nominal interest rates. There can be no assurance that the value of an inflation-linked security will be directly correlated to changes in interest rates; for example, if interest rates rise for reasons other than inflation, the increase may not be reflected in the security\\u2019s inflation measure.\\n\\nInvesting in inflation-linked bonds may also reduce the fund\\u2019s distributable income during periods of extreme deflation. If prices for goods and services decline throughout the economy, the principal and income on inflation-linked securities may decline and result in losses to the fund.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, that could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by the fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\nInvesting in derivatives \\u2014 The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and a derivative instrument may expose the fund to losses in excess of its initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult for the fund to buy or sell at an opportune time or price and may be difficult to terminate or otherwise offset. The fund\\u2019s use of derivatives may result in losses to the fund, and investing in derivatives may reduce the fund\\u2019s returns and increase the fund\\u2019s price volatility. The fund\\u2019s counterparty to a derivative transaction (including, if applicable, the fund\\u2019s clearing broker, the derivatives exchange or the clearinghouse) may be unable or unwilling to honor its financial obligations in respect of the transaction.\\n\\nLiquidity risk \\u2014 Certain fund holdings may be deemed to be less liquid or illiquid because they cannot be readily sold without significantly impacting the value of the holdings. Liquidity risk may result from the lack of an active market for a holding, legal or contractual restrictions on resale, or the reduced number and capacity of market participants to make a market in such holding. Market prices for less liquid or illiquid holdings may be volatile, and reduced liquidity may have an adverse impact on the market price of such holdings. Additionally, the sale of less liquid or illiquid holdings may involve substantial delays (including delays in settlement) and additional costs and the fund may be unable to sell such holdings when necessary to meet its liquidity needs.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund actively manages the fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the fund is subject to the risk that the methods and analyses employed by the investment adviser in this process may not produce the desired results. This could cause the fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. You should consider how this fund fits into your overall investment program.\\n\\nAmerican Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus     42\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvestment results The following bar chart shows how the investment results of the Class 1 shares of the fund have varied from year to year, and the following table shows how the fund\\u2019s average annual total returns for various periods compare with a broad measure of securities market results and other applicable measures of market results. This information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The Lipper Core Bond Funds Average includes mutual funds that disclose investment objectives and/or strategies reasonably comparable to those of the fund. Past investment results (before and after taxes) are not predictive of future investment results. Figures shown reflect fees and expenses associated with an investment in the fund, but do not reflect insurance contract fees and expenses.

These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your individual financial advisor to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your individual financial advisor or visit your financial intermediary\\u2019s website for more information. The fund is not sold directly to the general public but instead is offered as an underlying investment option for variable insurance contracts. In addition to payments described above, the fund and its related companies may make payments to the sponsoring insurance company (or its affiliates) for distribution and/or other services. These payments may be a factor that the insurance company considers in including the fund as an underlying investment option in the variable insurance contract. The prospectus (or other offering document) for your variable insurance contract may contain additional information about these payments.\",\n          \"Eaton Vance Real Estate Fund\\n\\nInvestment Objective\\n\\nThe Fund\\u2019s investment objective is to seek total return.\\n\\nFees and Expenses of the Fund\\n\\nThis table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund. Investors may also pay commissions or other fees to their financial intermediary when they buy and hold shares of the Fund, which are not reflected below. You may qualify for a reduced sales charge on purchases of Class A shares if you invest, or agree to invest over a 13-month period, at least $50,000 in Eaton Vance funds. Certain financial intermediaries also may offer variations in Fund sales charges to their customers as described in Appendix A \\u2013 Financial Intermediary Sales Charge Variations in this Prospectus. More information about these and other discounts is available from your financial intermediary and in Sales Charges beginning on page 51 of this Prospectus and page 26 of the Fund\\u2019s Statement of Additional Information.\\n\\nShareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment)\\tClass A\\tClass I\\nMaximum Sales Charge (Load) Imposed on Purchases (as a percentage of offering price)\\t5.75%\\tNone\\nMaximum Deferred Sales Charge (Load) (as a percentage of the lower of net asset value at purchase or redemption)\\tNone\\tNone\\n \\n\\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\tClass A\\tClass I\\nManagement Fees\\t0.80%\\t0.80%\\nDistribution and Service (12b-1) Fees\\t0.25%\\tNone\\nOther Expenses\\t0.37%\\t0.37%\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\t1.42%\\t1.17%\\nExpense Reimbursement(1)\\t(0.17)%\\t(0.17)%\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Expense Reimbursement\\t1.25%\\t1.00%\\n(1)\\tThe administrator has agreed to reimburse the Fund\\u2019s expenses to the extent that Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 1.25% for Class A shares and 1.00% for Class I shares. This expense reimbursement will continue through April 30, 2019. Any amendment to or termination of this reimbursement would require approval of the Board of Trustees. The expense reimbursement relates to ordinary operating expenses only and does not include expenses such as: brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses of unaffiliated funds, interest expense, taxes or litigation expenses. Amounts reimbursed may be recouped by the administrator during the same fiscal year to the extent actual expenses are less than the contractual expense cap during such year.\\nExample. This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, that the operating expenses remain the same and that any reimbursement arrangement remains in place for the contractual period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nClass A shares\\t$695\\t$983\\t$1,291\\t$2,165\\nClass I shares\\t$102\\t$355\\t$627\\t$1,405\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d the portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 36% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund seeks total return through a combination of capital appreciation and current income. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of companies primarily engaged in the real estate industry (the \\u201c80% Policy\\u201d). Although it invests primarily in domestic securities, the Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in foreign securities. As an alternative to holding foreign stocks directly, the Fund may invest in U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign companies that trade on U.S. exchanges, or in the over-the-counter market (including depositary receipts which evidence ownership in underlying foreign stocks). The Fund may invest in exchange-traded funds (\\u201cETFs\\u201d), a type of pooled investment vehicle, in order to\\n\\nEaton Vance Domestic Equity Funds\\t21\\tProspectus dated May 1, 2018\\n \\nmanage cash positions to seek exposure to certain market sectors. The Fund is \\u201cnon-diversified,\\u201d which means it may invest a greater percentage of its asset in the securities of a single issuer than a \\u201cdiversified\\u201d fund.\\n\\nCompanies primarily engaged in the real estate industry and other real estate-related investments may include publicly traded real estate investment trusts (\\u201cREITs\\u201d) or real estate operating companies that either own properties or make construction or mortgage loans, real estate developers, companies with substantial real estate holdings and other companies whose products and services are related to the real estate industry, such as lodging operators, brokers, property management companies, building supply manufacturers, mortgage lenders, or mortgage servicing companies. REITs tend to be small to medium-sized companies. The value of a REIT can depend on the structure of and cash flow generated by the REIT. REITs are pooled investment vehicles that have expenses of their own, so the Fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of those expenses. The Fund will not own real estate directly.\\n\\nThe portfolio manager generally seeks to purchase securities of companies that he believes are high in quality and reasonably priced in relation to their fundamental value. In selecting securities, the portfolio manager generally seeks companies believed to have the potential for above-average earnings growth and profit margins, as well as good appreciation prospects and income-producing potential. Investment decisions are made primarily on the basis of fundamental research. The portfolio manager utilizes information provided by, and the expertise of, the investment adviser\\u2019s research staff in making investment decisions. Factors the portfolio manager considers in selecting real estate companies include one or more of the following: asset quality; quality and experience of management; type and location of real estate owned; nature of a company\\u2019s real estate activities; sustainability of a company\\u2019s competitive position; balance sheet strength; free cash flow and growth thereof; and relative valuation. While stocks generally are acquired with the expectation of being held for the long term, securities may be sold if, in the opinion of the investment adviser, the price moves above a fair level of valuation, the company\\u2019s fundamentals deteriorate or to pursue more attractive investment options.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nMarket Risk. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic, political and financial events (whether real, expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. The frequency and magnitude of such changes in value cannot be predicted. Certain securities and other investments held by the Fund may experience increased volatility, illiquidity, or other potentially adverse effects in reaction to changing market conditions. Actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve or foreign central banks to stimulate or stabilize economic growth, such as decreases or increases in short-term interest rates, could cause high volatility in markets.\\n\\nEquity Securities Risk. The value of equity securities and related instruments may decline in response to adverse changes in the economy or the economic outlook; deterioration in investor sentiment; interest rate, currency, and commodity price fluctuations; adverse geopolitical, social or environmental developments; issuer and sector-specific considerations; or other factors. Market conditions may affect certain types of stocks to a greater extent than other types of stocks. If the stock market declines in value, the value of the Fund\\u2019s equity securities will also likely decline. Although prices can rebound, there is no assurance that values will return to previous levels.\\n\\nReal Estate Risk. Real estate investments are subject to risks associated with owning real estate, including declines in real estate values, increases in property taxes, fluctuations in interest rates, limited availability of mortgage financing, decreases in revenues from underlying real estate assets, declines in occupancy rates, changes in government regulations affecting zoning, land use, and rents, environmental liabilities, and risks related to the management skill and creditworthiness of the issuer. Companies in the real estate industry may also be subject to liabilities under environmental and hazardous waste laws, among others. REITs must satisfy specific requirements for favorable tax treatment and can involve unique risks in addition to the risks generally affecting the real estate industry. The Fund is not eligible for a deduction from dividends received from REITs that is available to individuals who invest directly in REITs. Changes in underlying real estate values may have an exaggerated effect to the extent that investments are concentrated in particular geographic regions or property types.\\n\\nIndustry Concentration Risk. Because the Fund concentrates its investments in the real estate industry, the value of Fund shares may be affected by events that adversely affect that industry and may fluctuate more than that of a fund that invests more broadly.\\n\\nIssuer Diversification Risk. The Fund is \\u201cnon-diversified,\\u201d which means it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than a fund that is \\u201cdiversified.\\u201d Non-diversified funds may focus their investments in a small number of issuers, making them more susceptible to risks affecting such issuers than a more diversified fund might be.\\n\\nSmaller Company Risk. The stocks of smaller, less seasoned companies are generally subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, higher transaction costs and higher investment risk than the stocks of larger, more established companies. Such companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources, may be dependent on a limited management group, and may lack substantial capital reserves or an established performance record. There may be generally less publicly available information about such companies than for larger, more established\\n\\nEaton Vance Domestic Equity Funds\\t22\\tProspectus dated May 1, 2018\\n \\ncompanies. Stocks of these companies frequently have lower trading volumes making them more volatile and potentially more difficult to value.\\n\\nForeign Investment Risk. Foreign investments can be adversely affected by political, economic and market developments abroad, including the imposition of economic and other sanctions by the United States or another country. Foreign markets may be smaller, less liquid and more volatile than the major markets in the United States, and as a result, Fund share values may be more volatile. Trading in foreign markets typically involves higher expense than trading in the United States. The Fund may have difficulties enforcing its legal or contractual rights in a foreign country. Depositary receipts are subject to many of the risks associated with investing directly in foreign instruments.\\n\\nCurrency Risk. Exchange rates for currencies fluctuate daily. The value of foreign investments may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar. Currency markets generally are not as regulated as securities markets and currency transactions are subject to settlement, custodial and other operational risks.\\n\\nETF Risk. ETFs are subject to the risks of investing in the underlying securities or other investments. ETF shares may trade at a premium or discount to net asset value and are subject to secondary market trading risks. In addition, the Fund will bear a pro rata portion of the operating expenses of an ETF in which it invests. Other pooled investment vehicles generally are subject to risks similar to those of ETFs. \\n\\nRisks Associated with Active Management. The success of the Fund\\u2019s investment strategy depends on portfolio management\\u2019s successful application of analytical skills and investment judgment. Active management involves subjective decisions.\\n\\nGeneral Fund Investing Risks. The Fund is not a complete investment program and there is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. It is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The Fund is designed to be a long-term investment vehicle and is not suited for short-term trading. Investors in the Fund should have a long-term investment perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value. Purchase and redemption activities by Fund shareholders may impact the management of the Fund and its ability to achieve its investment objective(s). In addition, the redemption by one or more large shareholders or groups of shareholders of their holdings in the Fund could have an adverse impact on the remaining shareholders in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund\\u2019s performance from year to year and how the Fund\\u2019s average annual returns over time compare with those of two broad-based securities market indices. The returns in the bar chart are for Class A shares and do not reflect a sales charge. If the sales charge was reflected, returns would be lower. Past performance (both before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. The Fund\\u2019s performance reflects the effects of expense reductions. Absent these reductions, performance would have been lower.

The Class A performance shown above for the period prior to June 9, 2010 (commencement of operations) is the performance of Class I shares, adjusted for the sales charge that applies to Class A shares but not adjusted for any other differences in the expenses of the two classes. If adjusted for such differences, returns would be different. Investors cannot invest directly in an Index.\\n\\nAfter-tax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder\\u2019s tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions, and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-deferred accounts or to shares held by non-taxable entities. After-tax returns for other Classes of shares will vary from the after-tax returns presented for Class A shares. Return After Taxes on Distributions for a period may be the same as Return Before Taxes for that period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Also, Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares for a period may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares.\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nInvestment Adviser.

Investors may also pay commissions or other fees to their financial intermediary when they buy and hold shares of the Fund, which are not reflected below. You may qualify for a reduced sales charge on purchases of Class A shares if you invest, or agree to invest over a 13-month period, at least $100,000 in Eaton Vance funds. Certain financial intermediaries also may offer variations in Fund sales charges to their customers as described in Appendix A \\u2013 Financial Intermediary Sales Charge Variations in this Prospectus. More information about these and other discounts is available from your financial intermediary and in Sales Charges on page 20 of this Prospectus and page 21 of the Fund\\u2019s Statement of Additional Information.\\n\\nShareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment)\\tClass A\\tClass C\\tClass I\\nMaximum Sales Charge (Load) Imposed on Purchases (as a percentage of offering price)\\t2.25%\\tNone\\tNone\\nMaximum Deferred Sales Charge (Load) (as a percentage of the lower of net asset value at purchase or redemption)\\tNone\\t1.00%\\tNone\\n \\n\\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\tClass A\\tClass C\\tClass I\\nManagement Fees\\t0.55%\\t0.55%\\t0.55%\\nDistribution and Service (12b-1) Fees\\t0.25%\\t1.00%\\tNone\\nOther Expenses\\t0.10%\\t0.10%\\t0.10%\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\t0.90%\\t1.65%\\t0.65%\\nExample. This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, that the operating expenses remain the same and that any expense reimbursement arrangement remains in place for the contractual period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\tExpenses with Redemption\\tExpenses without Redemption\\n \\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nClass A shares\\t$315\\t$506\\t$712\\t$1,308\\t$315\\t$506\\t$712\\t$1,308\\nClass C shares\\t$268\\t$520\\t$897\\t$1,955\\t$168\\t$520\\t$897\\t$1,955\\nClass I shares\\t$66\\t$208\\t$362\\t$810\\t$66\\t$208\\t$362\\t$810\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d the portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 54% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations, the interest on which is exempt from regular federal income tax (the \\u201c80% Policy\\u201d). In seeking the Fund\\u2019s investment objective, the portfolio managers emphasize tax-exempt income. The Fund normally invests in municipal obligations rated in the three highest rating categories (those rated A or higher by S&P Global Ratings (\\u201cS&P\\u201d), Fitch Ratings (\\u201cFitch\\u201d) or Moody\\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\\u201cMoody\\u2019s\\u201d)) or, if unrated, determined by the investment adviser to be of comparable quality at the time of purchase. The Fund will not invest more\\n\\nEaton Vance TABS Municipal Bond Funds\\t3\\tProspectus dated June 1, 2018\\n \\nthan 50% of its net assets in municipal obligations rated A at the time of purchase by S&P, Fitch or Moody\\u2019s or, if unrated, determined by the investment adviser to be of comparable quality. For purposes of rating restrictions, if securities are rated differently by two or more rating agencies, the highest rating is used. The Fund may continue to hold securities that are downgraded (including bonds downgraded to below investment grade credit quality (\\u201cjunk bonds\\u201d)) if the investment adviser believes it would be advantageous to do so. The Fund will not invest in a municipal obligation the interest on which the Fund\\u2019s investment adviser believes is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.\\n\\nFor its investment in municipal obligations, the Fund invests primarily in general obligation or revenue bonds. The Fund currently targets an average portfolio duration of approximately 2 - 4.5 years and an average weighted portfolio maturity of approximately 3 - 6 years, but may invest in securities of any maturity or duration, and may in the future alter its maturity or duration target range. The Fund may use various techniques to shorten or lengthen its dollar-weighted average portfolio duration, including the acquisition of municipal obligations at a premium or discount. The portfolio managers generally will seek to enhance after-tax total return by actively engaging in relative value trading within the portfolio to take advantage of price opportunities in the markets for municipal obligations. With respect to 20% of its net assets, the Fund may invest in municipal obligations that are not exempt from regular federal income tax, direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury and/or obligations of U.S. Government agencies, instrumentalities and government-sponsored enterprises. The Fund may also invest in cash and money market instruments.\\n\\nThe investment adviser\\u2019s process for selecting municipal obligations for purchase and sale generally includes consideration of the creditworthiness of the issuer or person obligated to repay the obligation. In evaluating creditworthiness, the investment adviser considers ratings assigned by rating agencies and generally performs additional credit and investment analysis.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nMarket Risk. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic, political and financial events (whether real, expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. The frequency and magnitude of such changes in value cannot be predicted. Certain securities and other investments held by the Fund may experience increased volatility, illiquidity, or other potentially adverse effects in reaction to changing market conditions. Actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve or foreign central banks to stimulate or stabilize economic growth, such as decreases or increases in short-term interest rates, could cause high volatility in markets. No active trading market may exist for certain investments, which may impair the ability of the Fund to sell or to realize the current valuation of such investments in the event of the need to liquidate such assets. Fixed-income markets may experience periods of relatively high volatility in an environment where U.S. treasury yields are rising.\\n\\nMunicipal Obligation Risk. The amount of public information available about municipal obligations is generally less than for corporate equities or bonds, meaning that the investment performance of municipal obligations may be more dependent on the analytical abilities of the investment adviser than stock or corporate bond investments. The secondary market for municipal obligations also tends to be less well-developed and less liquid than many other securities markets, which may limit the Fund\\u2019s ability to sell its municipal obligations at attractive prices. The differences between the price at which an obligation can be purchased and the price at which it can be sold may widen during periods of market distress. Less liquid obligations can become more difficult to value and be subject to erratic price movements. The increased presence of nontraditional participants (such as proprietary trading desks of investment banks and hedge funds) or the absence of traditional participants (such as individuals, insurance companies, banks and life insurance companies) in the municipal markets may lead to greater volatility in the markets because non-traditional participants may trade more frequently or in greater volume. \\n\\nInterest Rate Risk. In general, the value of income securities will fluctuate based on changes in interest rates. The value of these securities is likely to increase when interest rates fall and decline when interest rates rise. Generally, securities with longer durations are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than shorter duration securities, causing them to be more volatile. Conversely, fixed income securities with shorter durations will be less volatile but may provide lower returns than fixed income securities with longer durations. The Fund may own individual investments that have longer durations. In a rising interest rate environment, the durations of income securities that have the ability to be prepaid or called by the issuer may be extended. In a declining interest rate environment, the proceeds from prepaid or maturing instruments may have to be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\\n\\nCredit Risk. Investments in municipal obligations and other debt obligations (referred to below as \\u201cdebt instruments\\u201d) are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled principal and interest. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may reduce the capacity of the party obligated to make principal and interest payments on such instruments and may lead to defaults. Such non-payments and defaults may reduce the value of Fund shares and income distributions. The value of debt instruments also may decline because of concerns about the issuer\\u2019s ability to make principal and interest payments. In addition, the credit ratings of debt instruments may be lowered if the financial condition of the party obligated to make payments with respect to such instruments deteriorates. In order to enforce its rights in the\\n\\nEaton Vance TABS Municipal Bond Funds\\t4\\tProspectus dated June 1, 2018\\n \\nevent of a default, bankruptcy or similar situation, the Fund may be required to retain legal or similar counsel, which may increase the Fund\\u2019s operating expenses and adversely affect net asset value. Municipal obligations may be insured as to principal and interest payments. If the claims-paying ability or other rating of the insurer is downgraded by a rating agency, the value of such obligations may be negatively affected.\\n\\nRisks of Principal Only Investments. Principal only investments entitle the Fund to receive the stated value of such investment when held to maturity. The values of principal only investments are subject to greater fluctuation in response to changes in market interest rates than obligations that pay interest currently. The Fund will accrue income on these investments and distribute that income each year. The Fund may be required to sell other investments to obtain cash needed for such income distributions.\\n\\nU.S. Government Securities Risk. Although certain U.S. Government-sponsored agencies (such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association) may be chartered or sponsored by acts of Congress, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. U.S. Treasury securities generally have a lower return than other obligations because of their higher credit quality and market liquidity.\\n\\nTax Risk. Income from tax-exempt municipal obligations could be declared taxable because of changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the relevant taxing authority or the non-compliant conduct of the issuer of an obligation.\\n\\nMoney Market Instrument Risk. Money market instruments may be adversely affected by market and economic events, such as a sharp rise in prevailing short-term interest rates; adverse developments in the banking industry, which issues or guarantees many money market instruments; adverse economic, political or other developments affecting issuers of money market instruments; changes in the credit quality of issuers; and default by a counterparty.\\n\\nGeneral Fund Investing Risks. The Fund is not a complete investment program and there is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. It is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The Fund is designed to be a long-term investment vehicle and is not suited for short-term trading. Investors in the Fund should have a long-term investment perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value. Purchase and redemption activities by Fund shareholders may impact the management of the Fund and its ability to achieve its investment objective(s). In addition, the redemption by one or more large shareholders or groups of shareholders of their holdings in the Fund could have an adverse impact on the remaining shareholders in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund\\u2019s performance from year to year and how the Fund\\u2019s average annual returns over time compare with those of two broad-based securities market indices.\\n\\nThe Fund commenced operations on March 27, 2009 and is the successor to the operations of a private limited partnership (the \\u201cPredecessor Account\\u201d). The Predecessor Account was managed by Eaton Vance and had substantially the same investment objective, policies and strategies as the Fund. However, the Predecessor Account was not a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \\u201c1940 Act\\u201d) or a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \\u201cCode\\u201d), and therefore the Predecessor Account was not subject to the investment limitations, diversification requirements and other restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act and/or the Code. If such requirements were applicable to the Predecessor Account, the performance shown may have been adversely affected.\\n\\nEaton Vance TABS Municipal Bond Funds\\t5\\tProspectus dated June 1, 2018\\n \\n \\n\\nThe performance of each Class for the period prior to March 27, 2009 is that of the Predecessor Account. The returns in the bar chart for periods after March 27, 2009 are for Class A shares of the Fund and do not reflect a sales charge. If the sales charge was reflected, the returns would be lower. The Fund\\u2019s performance for certain periods after March 27, 2009 reflects the effects of expense reductions. Absent these reductions, performance for certain periods would have been lower. Effective February 17, 2015, the Fund changed its name, objective and investment strategy to invest at least 80% of its net assets in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations, the interest on which is exempt from regular federal income tax. Past performance (both before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated Fund performance information can be obtained by visiting www.eatonvance.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the ten years ended December 31, 2017, the highest quarterly total return for the Fund or Predecessor Account was 5.03% for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and the lowest quarterly return for the Fund or Predecessor Account was -2.36% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The year-to-date total return through the end of the most recent calendar quarter (December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018) was -0.99%.\\n\\nAverage Annual Total Return as of December 31, 2017\\tOne Year\\tFive Years\\tTen Years\\nClass A Return Before Taxes\\t-0.26%\\t0.45%\\t2.45%\\nClass A Return After Taxes on Distributions\\t-0.30%\\t0.34%\\t---\\nClass A Return After Taxes on Distributions and the Sale of Class A Shares\\t0.40%\\t0.56%\\t---\\nClass C Return Before Taxes\\t0.21%\\t0.14%\\t2.01%\\nClass I Return Before Taxes\\t2.32%\\t1.14%\\t2.90%\\nBloomberg  Barclays  5 Year Municipal Bond Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)\\t3.14%\\t1.83%\\t3.54%\\nBloomberg Barclays Municipal Managed Money 1-7 Year Bond Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)\\t2.41%\\t1.38%\\t2.98%\\nThese returns reflect the maximum sales charge for Class A (2.25%) and any applicable contingent deferred sales charge (\\u201cCDSC\\u201d) for Class C. The performance shown above for each Class for the period prior to March 27, 2009 (commencement of operations) is that of the Predecessor Account adjusted to reflect any applicable sales charge or CDSC of the Class but not adjusted for any other differences in expenses. If adjusted for such differences, returns would be different. Investors cannot invest directly in an Index.\\n\\nAfter-Tax Return is calculated using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates and does not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder\\u2019s tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions, and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-deferred accounts or to shares held by non-taxable entities. After-tax returns for other Classes of shares will vary from the after-tax returns presented for Class A shares. Return After Taxes on Distributions for a period may be the same as Return Before Taxes for that period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Also, Return After Taxes on distributions and Sale of Fund Shares for a period may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares. After-Tax Returns are not shown for the Ten Years ending December 31, 2017 because the Predecessor Account, unlike a registered investment company, was not required to make annual income distributions to its investors.\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nInvestment Adviser.

It illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you were to invest $10,000 in the Fund\\u2019s shares. This example assumes that the Fund provides a return of 5% each year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table. You would incur these hypothetical expenses whether or not you redeem your investment at the end of the given period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\n$8\\t$26\\t$45\\t$103\\n \\n\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the fiscal period from September 26, 2017, to January 31, 2018, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 1% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Transition Index, an interim index that will gradually increase exposure to other real estate-related investments while proportionately reducing exposure to other stocks based on their weightings in the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index. The MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index is made up of stocks of large, mid-size, and small U.S. companies within the real estate sector, as classified under the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). The GICS real estate sector is composed of equity real estate investment trusts (known as REITs), which includes specialized REITs, and real estate management and development companies.\\n\\nThe Fund attempts to replicate the Index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.\\n\\n2\\n\\n \\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Industry concentration risk, which is the chance that the stocks of REITs and other real estate-related investments will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. Because the Fund concentrates its assets in these stocks, industry concentration risk is high.\\n\\n\\u2022 Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund\\u2019s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a limited number of companies, which could cause the Fund to underperform the overall stock market.\\n\\n\\u2022 Interest rate risk, which is the chance that REIT stock prices overall will decline and that the cost of borrowing for REITs will increase because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk is high for the Fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Investment style risk, which is the chance that the returns from the stocks of REITs and other real estate-related investments\\u2014which typically are small- or mid-capitalization stocks\\u2014will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, these stocks have performed quite differently from the overall market.\\n\\n\\u2022 Nondiversification risk, which is the chance that the Fund may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a particular issuer or group of issuers or may own larger positions of an issuer\\u2019s voting stock than a diversified fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Asset concentration risk, which is the chance that, because the Fund\\u2019s target index (and therefore the Fund) tends to be heavily weighted in its ten largest holdings, the Fund\\u2019s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe Fund has not been in operation long enough to report a full calendar-year return.

During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 24% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund invests primarily in common stocks and seeks to invest in companies that appear to offer superior opportunities for growth of capital. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in common stocks and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\nThe investment adviser uses a system of multiple portfolio managers in managing the fund\\u2019s assets. Under this approach, the portfolio of the fund is divided into segments managed by individual managers who decide how their respective segments will be invested.\\n\\nThe fund relies on the professional judgment of its investment adviser to make decisions about the fund\\u2019s portfolio investments. The basic investment philosophy of the investment adviser is to seek to invest in attractively valued companies that, in its opinion, represent good, long-term investment opportunities. The investment adviser believes that an important way to accomplish this is through fundamental analysis, which may include meeting with company executives and employees, suppliers, customers and competitors. Securities may be sold when the investment adviser believes that they no longer represent relatively attractive investment opportunities.\\n\\n7     American Funds Insurance Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPrincipal risks\\n\\nThis section describes the principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s principal investment strategies. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks and other securities held by the fund may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental or governmental agency responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the fund may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nInvesting in growth-oriented stocks \\u2014 Growth-oriented common stocks and other equity-type securities (such as preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks and convertible bonds) may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments. These risks may be even greater in the case of smaller capitalization stocks.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, that could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by the fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund actively manages the fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the fund is subject to the risk that the methods and analyses employed by the investment adviser in this process may not produce the desired results. This could cause the fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person.

Ask your individual financial advisor or visit your financial intermediary\\u2019s website for more information. The fund is not sold directly to the general public but instead is offered as an underlying investment option for variable insurance contracts. In addition to payments described above, the fund and its related companies may make payments to the sponsoring insurance company (or its affiliates) for distribution and/or other services. These payments may be a factor that the insurance company considers in including the fund as an underlying investment option in the variable insurance contract.
