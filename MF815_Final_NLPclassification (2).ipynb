In addition to the fees and expenses described below, your broker may also require you to pay brokerage commissions on purchases and sales of certain share classes of the fund.\\n\\nYou may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in the fund or certain other Fidelity\\u00ae funds. More information about these and other discounts is available from your investment professional and in the \\\"Fund Distribution\\\" section beginning on page 50 of the prospectus. Different intermediaries may provide additional waivers or reductions of the sales charge. Please see \\u201cSales Charge Waiver Policies Applied by Certain Intermediaries\\u201d in the \\u201cAppendix\\u201d section of the prospectus.\\n\\nShareholder fees\\n\\n(fees paid directly from your investment)\\n\\n \\tClass A \\tClass I \\nMaximum sales charge (load) on purchases (as a % of offering price) \\t2.75% \\tNone \\nMaximum contingent deferred sales charge (as a % of the lesser of original purchase price or redemption proceeds) \\tNone(a) \\tNone \\n(a)  Purchases of $250,000 or more will not be subject to a front-end sales charge, but may be subject to a 0.50% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) if the intermediary firm has elected an upfront finder's fee at the time the shares are purchased, or a 0.75% CDSC if the shares purchased are recordkept in a Fidelity Advisor\\u00ae 401(k) Retirement Plan.\\n\\nAnnual Operating Expenses\\n\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a % of the value of your investment)\\n\\n \\tClass A \\tClass I \\nManagement fee \\t0.30% \\t0.30% \\nDistribution and/or Service (12b-1) fees \\t0.25% \\tNone \\nOther expenses \\t0.10% \\t0.10% \\nTotal annual operating expenses \\t0.65% \\t0.40% \\nThis example helps compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other funds.\\n\\nLet's say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that your shareholder fees and the annual operating expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated:\\n\\n \\tClass A \\tClass I \\n1 year \\t$340 \\t$41 \\n3 years \\t$477 \\t$128 \\n5 years \\t$627 \\t$224 \\n10 years \\t$1,063 \\t$505 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 8% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nNormally investing at least 80% of assets in investment-grade municipal securities whose interest is exempt from federal income tax (but may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax).\\nManaging the fund to have similar overall interest rate risk compared to a customized municipal bond index representing Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR)'s view of the performance of the fund\\u2019s competitive universe.\\nAllocating assets across different market sectors and maturities.\\nPotentially investing more than 25% of total assets in municipal securities that finance similar types of projects.\\nAnalyzing the credit quality of the issuer, security-specific features, current and potential future valuation, and trading opportunities to select investments.\\nLiquidating shortly after the fund's target end-date of June 30, 2021.\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nMunicipal Market Volatility.  The municipal market is volatile and can be significantly affected by adverse tax, legislative, or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities.\\nInterest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt security to decrease.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease.\\nDeclining Yield Risk.  As the fund approaches its liquidation date, the fund's securities will mature and the fund may reinvest the proceeds in money market securities with lower yields than the securities previously held by the fund.\\nFluctuation of Yield & Liquidation Amount Risk.  The amount of the fund's income distributions will vary over time, and the breakdown of returns between fund distributions and liquidation proceeds will not be predictable at the time of your investment, and you may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Unlike individual debt securities, which typically pay principal at maturity, the value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. You could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund. The information illustrates the changes in the performance of the fund's shares from year to year and compares the performance of the fund's shares to the performance of a securities market index and an additional index over various periods of time. The indexes have characteristics relevant to the fund's investment strategies. Index descriptions appear in the \\\"Additional Index Information\\\" section of the prospectus. Past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future performance.\\n\\nVisit institutional.fidelity.com for more recent performance information.\\n\\nYear-by-Year Returns\\n\\nThe returns in the bar chart do not reflect any applicable sales charges; if sales charges were reflected, returns would be lower than those shown.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the periods shown in the chart for Class A: \\tReturns \\tQuarter ended \\nHighest Quarter Return \\t2.53% \\tJune 30, 2014 \\nLowest Quarter Return \\t(3.73)% \\tJune 30, 2013 \\nYear-to-Date Return \\t0.32% \\tJune 30, 2018 \\nAverage Annual Returns\\n\\nUnlike the returns in the bar chart, the returns in the table reflect the maximum applicable sales charges. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates, but do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. After-tax returns for Class A are shown in the table below and after-tax returns for other classes will vary. Actual after-tax returns may differ depending on your individual circumstances. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares may be higher than other returns for the same period due to a tax benefit of realizing a capital loss upon the sale of fund shares.\\n\\nFor the periods ended December 31, 2017 \\tPast 1 year \\tPast 5 years \\tLife of class(a) \\nClass A - Return Before Taxes \\t(0.63)% \\t1.10% \\t2.99% \\nReturn After Taxes on Distributions \\t(0.63)% \\t1.07% \\t2.94% \\nReturn After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares \\t0.37% \\t1.29% \\t2.78% \\nClass I - Return Before Taxes \\t2.43% \\t1.92% \\t3.68% \\nBloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index\\n(reflects no deduction for fees, expenses, or taxes) \\t5.45% \\t3.02% \\t4.28% \\nBloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond 2021 Index Ex Tobacco/Prepaid Gas\\n(reflects no deduction for fees, expenses, or taxes) \\t2.76% \\t1.93% \\t3.77% \\n(a)  From May 19, 2011\\n\\nInvestment Adviser\\n\\nFMR (the Adviser) is the fund's manager.

The price to buy one share of Class I is its NAV. Shares will be bought at the offering price or NAV, as applicable, next calculated after an order is received in proper form.\\n\\nThe price to sell one share of Class A is its NAV, minus any applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). The price to sell one share of Class I is its NAV. Shares will be sold at the NAV next calculated after an order is received in proper form, minus any applicable CDSC.\\n\\nThe fund is open for business each day the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open.\\n\\nThere is no purchase minimum for Class A or Class I shares.\\n\\nTax Information\\n\\nThe fund seeks to earn income and pay dividends exempt from federal income tax. Income exempt from federal income tax may be subject to state or local tax. A portion of the dividends you receive may be subject to federal and state income taxes and may also be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. You may also receive taxable distributions attributable to the fund's sale of municipal bonds.\\n\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries\\n\\nThe fund, the Adviser, Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), and/or their affiliates may pay intermediaries, which may include banks, broker-dealers, retirement plan sponsors, administrators, or service-providers (who may be affiliated with the Adviser or FDC), for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing your intermediary and your investment professional to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your investment professional or visit your intermediary's web site for more information.\",\n          \"American Funds Conservative Growth and Income Portfolio\\n\\nInvestment objective The fund\\u2019s investment objective is to provide current income and, secondarily, long-term growth of capital.\\n\\nFees and expenses of the fund This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund.

The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. The example reflects the fee waiver described above through the expiration date of such waiver and total annual operating expenses thereafter. You may be required to pay brokerage commissions on your purchases and sales of Class F-2 or F-3 shares of the fund, which are not reflected in the example.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 1% of the average value of its portfolio or there was no turnover.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund will attempt to achieve its investment objective by investing in a mix of American Funds in different combinations and weightings. The underlying American Funds will typically seek to generate income from their investments and may include growth-and-income, equity-income, balanced and bond funds.\\n\\nThrough its investments in the underlying funds, the fund will have significant exposure to dividend-paying stocks. The fund will seek exposure to issuers domiciled outside the United States, including those domiciled in emerging markets. The investment adviser believes that exposure to issuers domiciled outside the United States can help provide diversification when seeking current income and long-term growth of capital.\\n\\nWith respect to its fixed-income investments, the underlying funds in which the fund invests may hold debt securities with a wide range of quality and maturities. The fund may invest in underlying funds with significant exposure to bonds rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser, or unrated but determined by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser to be of equivalent quality. Securities rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below are sometimes referred to as \\u201cjunk bonds.\\u201d Exposure to lower rated securities may help the fund achieve its objective of providing current income.\\n\\nThe underlying funds may hold securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government, securities issued by federal agencies and instrumentalities and securities backed by mortgages or other assets. The underlying funds may also invest in the debt securities of governments, agencies, corporations and other entities domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\nThe fund\\u2019s investment adviser seeks to create combinations of underlying funds that complement each other with a goal of achieving the fund\\u2019s investment objective of providing current income and, secondarily, long-term growth of capital. In making this determination, the fund\\u2019s investment adviser considers the historical volatility and returns of the underlying funds and how various combinations would have behaved in past market environments. It also considers, among other topics, current market conditions and the investment positions of the underlying funds.\\n\\nThe fund\\u2019s investment adviser periodically reviews the investment strategies and asset mix of the underlying funds. The investment adviser will also consider whether overall market conditions would favor a change in the exposure of the fund to various asset types or geographic regions. Based on these considerations, the investment adviser may make adjustments to underlying fund holdings by adjusting the percentage of individual underlying funds within the fund, or adding or removing underlying funds. The investment adviser may also determine not to change the underlying fund allocations, particularly in response to short-term market movements, if in its opinion the combination of underlying funds is appropriate to meet the fund\\u2019s investment objective.\\n\\nAmerican Funds Portfolio Series / Prospectus     28\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPrincipal risks This section describes the principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s and its underlying funds\\u2019 principal investment strategies. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s investment strategies.\\n\\nAllocation risk \\u2014 Investments in the fund are subject to risks related to the investment adviser\\u2019s allocation choices. The selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund\\u2019s assets could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nFund structure \\u2014 The fund invests in underlying funds and incurs expenses related to the underlying funds. In addition, investors in the fund will incur fees to pay for certain expenses related to the operations of the fund. An investor holding the underlying funds directly and in the same proportions as the fund would incur lower overall expenses but would not receive the benefit of the portfolio management and other services provided by the fund.\\n\\nUnderlying fund risks \\u2014 Because the fund\\u2019s investments consist of underlying funds, the fund\\u2019s risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. For this reason, it is important to understand the risks associated with investing in the underlying funds, as described below.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the underlying funds\\u2019 investment strategies.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks, bonds and other securities held by the underlying funds may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental or governmental agency responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the underlying funds may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nInvesting in stocks \\u2014 Investing in stocks may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments. As a result, the value of the underlying funds may be subject to sharp, short-term declines in value. Income provided by an underlying fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available at, the companies in which the underlying fund invests.\\n\\nInvesting in growth-oriented stocks \\u2014 Growth-oriented common stocks and other equity-type securities (such as preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks and convertible bonds) may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments.\\n\\nInvesting in income-oriented stocks \\u2014 Income provided by an underlying fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the underlying fund invests.\\n\\nInvesting in debt instruments \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, bonds and other debt securities held by an underlying fund may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the effective maturities and credit ratings of these securities.\\n\\nRising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities generally have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter maturity debt securities.\\n\\nBonds and other debt securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer will weaken and/or an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default. Credit risk is gauged, in part, by the credit ratings of the debt securities in which the underlying fund invests. However, ratings are only the opinions of the rating agencies issuing them and are not guarantees as to credit quality or an evaluation of market risk. The underlying funds\\u2019 investment adviser relies on its own credit analysts to research issuers and issues in seeking to mitigate various credit and default risks.\\n\\nInvesting in lower rated debt instruments \\u2014 Lower rated bonds and other lower rated debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuer\\u2019s creditworthiness than those of higher quality debt securities. The market prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of higher quality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. These risks may be increased with respect to investments in junk bonds.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, that could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by an underlying fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\n29     American Funds Portfolio Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in securities backed by the U.S. government \\u2014 Securities backed by the U.S. Treasury or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are guaranteed only as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity. Accordingly, the current market values for these securities will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Securities issued by government-sponsored entities and federal agencies and instrumentalities that are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. government.\\n\\nInvesting in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities \\u2014 Mortgage-related securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities, include debt obligations that represent interests in pools of mortgages or other income-bearing assets, such as consumer loans or receivables. Such securities often involve risks that are different from or more acute than the risks associated with investing in other types of debt securities. Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are subject to changes in the payment patterns of borrowers of the underlying debt. When interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to refinance or prepay their debt before its stated maturity. This may result in an underlying fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities, effectively reducing the underlying fund\\u2019s income. Conversely, if interest rates rise and borrowers repay their debt more slowly than expected, the time in which the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are paid off could be extended, reducing an underlying fund\\u2019s cash available for reinvestment in higher yielding securities.\\n\\nLiquidity risk \\u2014 Certain underlying fund holdings may be deemed to be less liquid or illiquid because they cannot be readily sold without significantly impacting the value of the holdings. Liquidity risk may result from the lack of an active market for a holding, legal or contractual restrictions on resale, or the reduced number and capacity of market participants to make a market in such holding. Market prices for less liquid or illiquid holdings may be volatile, and reduced liquidity may have an adverse impact on the market price of such holdings. Additionally, the sale of less liquid or illiquid holdings may involve substantial delays (including delays in settlement) and additional costs and the underlying fund may be unable to sell such holdings when necessary to meet its liquidity needs.\\n\\nInvesting in future delivery contracts \\u2014 An underlying fund may enter into contracts, such as to-be-announced contracts and mortgage dollar rolls, that involve an underlying fund selling mortgage-related securities and simultaneously contracting to repurchase similar securities for delivery at a future date at a predetermined price. This can increase the underlying fund\\u2019s market exposure, and the market price of the securities that the underlying fund contracts to repurchase could drop below their purchase price. While an underlying fund can preserve and generate capital through the use of such contracts by, for example, realizing the difference between the sale price and the future purchase price, the income generated by the underlying fund may be reduced by engaging in such transactions. In addition, these transactions may increase the turnover rate of the underlying fund.\\n\\nInvesting in inflation-linked bonds \\u2014 The values of inflation-linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates \\u2014 i.e., rates of interest after factoring in inflation. A rise in real interest rates may cause the prices of inflation-linked securities to fall, while a decline in real interest rates may cause the prices to increase. Inflation-linked bonds may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations when real interest rates rise faster than nominal interest rates. There can be no assurance that the value of an inflation-linked security will be directly correlated to changes in interest rates; for example, if interest rates rise for reasons other than inflation, the increase may not be reflected in the security\\u2019s inflation measure.\\n\\nInvesting in inflation-linked bonds may also reduce an underlying fund\\u2019s distributable income during periods of extreme deflation. If prices for goods and services decline throughout the economy, the principal and income on inflation-linked securities may decline and result in losses to the underlying fund.\\n\\nInvesting in derivatives \\u2014 The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and a derivative instrument may expose the underlying fund to losses in excess of its initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult for the underlying fund to buy or sell at an opportune time or price and may be difficult to terminate or otherwise offset. The underlying fund\\u2019s use of derivatives may result in losses to the underlying fund, and investing in derivatives may reduce the underlying fund\\u2019s returns and increase the underlying fund\\u2019s price volatility. The underlying fund\\u2019s counterparty to a derivative transaction (including, if applicable, the underlying fund\\u2019s clearing broker, the derivatives exchange or the clearinghouse) may be unable or unwilling to honor its financial obligations in respect of the transaction.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund and to the underlying funds actively manages each underlying fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the underlying funds are subject to the risk that the methods and analyses employed by the investment adviser in this process may not produce the desired results. This could cause an underlying fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. You should consider how this fund fits into your overall investment program.\\n\\nAmerican Funds Portfolio Series / Prospectus     30\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvestment results The following bar chart shows how the fund\\u2019s investment results have varied from year to year, and the following table shows how the fund\\u2019s average annual total returns for various periods compare with a broad measure of securities market results and other applicable measures of market results. This information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The fund has selected to add the MSCI All Country World ex USA Index and the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index as dual primary indexes with the S&P 500 Index. These additions will provide a better range of comparison benchmarks to measure the series' objective. The Lipper Mixed-Asset Target Allocation Moderate Funds Index includes funds that disclose investment objectives and/or strategies reasonably comparable to those of the fund.

The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and reinvest all dividends and distributions. The Example also assumes that your\\n76\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson International Opportunities Fund\\n \\n\\ninvestment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund\\u2019s operating expenses without waivers remain the same.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. The portfolio turnover rate of Henderson International Opportunities Fund (the \\u201cPredecessor Fund\\u201d) and the Fund for the fiscal year August 1, 2016 to July 31, 2017 was 51% of the average value of the portfolio. The portfolio turnover rate of the Fund for the fiscal period August 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017 was 5% of the average value of the portfolio.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES\\nThe Fund pursues its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 40% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of non-U.S. companies and in at least three different countries. Equity securities include common stocks and related securities, such as preferred stock, convertible securities, and depositary receipts. Non-U.S. companies include companies in emerging market countries and are broadly defined to include any company that meets one of the following tests: (i) its country of organization, its primary business office and/or the principal trading market of its stock are located outside of the U.S., (ii) 50% or more of its assets are located in a country other than the U.S., or (iii) 50% or more of its revenues are derived from outside of the U.S.\\nFund investment performance will be derived primarily from stock selection. A strategic asset allocation process will be a secondary contributor to the investment process. Security selection may be based upon an analysis of a company\\u2019s valuations relative to earnings forecasts or other valuation criteria, earnings growth prospects of a company, the quality of a company\\u2019s management and the unique competitive advantages of a company. Asset allocation will be reviewed regularly based upon strategic views related to the growth prospects, valuations and pricing associated with international equity regions. Assets of the Fund are allocated to teams of portfolio managers who have experience with respect to a particular geographic region or discipline.\\nThe Fund generally sells a stock when, in the portfolio managers\\u2019 opinions, there is a deterioration in the company\\u2019s fundamentals, the company fails to meet performance expectations, the stock achieves its target price, its earnings are disappointing or its revenue growth has slowed. The Fund may also sell a stock if the portfolio managers believe that negative country or regional factors may affect the company\\u2019s outlook, in the portfolio managers\\u2019 opinion, a superior investment opportunity arises or to meet cash requirements. The portfolio managers anticipate that the Fund will continue to hold securities of companies that grow or expand so long as the portfolio managers believe the securities continue to offer prospects of long-term growth. Some of the Fund\\u2019s investments may produce income, although income from dividends and interest will be incidental and not an important consideration in choosing investments.\\n77\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson International Opportunities Fund\\n \\n\\nThe Fund may, under unusual circumstances, invest in a single country or a limited number of countries. In addition, the Fund may invest in securities issued by smaller companies and in less seasoned issuers, including through initial public offerings and private placements.\\nThe Fund may invest its assets in derivatives, which are instruments that have a value derived from, or directly linked to, an underlying asset, such as equity securities, commodities, or currencies, as substitutes for securities in which the Fund invests. In particular, the Fund may invest in derivatives such as forward currency contracts to offset risks associated with currency exposure.\\nThe Fund may engage in active and frequent trading to achieve its investment objective. The Fund does not limit its investments to companies of any particular size and may invest a significant portion of its assets in smaller and less seasoned issuers. However, in an attempt to reduce portfolio risks, the portfolio managers generally will invest across countries, industry groups and/or sectors.\\nThe Fund may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, in an amount equal to up to one-third of its total assets as determined at the time of the loan origination.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS\\nThe biggest risk is that the Fund\\u2019s returns will vary, and you could lose money. The Fund is designed for long-term investors seeking a global equity portfolio, including common stocks. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than many other investment choices.\\nForeign Exposure Risk.  The Fund normally has significant exposure to foreign markets as a result of its investments in foreign securities and derivatives that provide exposure to foreign markets, including investments in emerging markets, which can be more volatile than the U.S. markets. As a result, its returns and net asset value may be affected to a large degree by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or political or economic conditions in a particular country. In some foreign markets, there may not be protection against failure by other parties to complete transactions. It may not be possible for the Fund to repatriate capital, dividends, interest, and other income from a particular country or governmental entity. In addition, a market swing in one or more countries or regions where the Fund has invested a significant amount of its assets may have a greater effect on the Fund\\u2019s performance than it would in a more geographically diversified portfolio. To the extent the Fund invests in foreign debt securities, such investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Additionally, investments in securities of foreign governments involve the risk that a foreign government may not be willing or able to pay interest or repay principal when due. The Fund\\u2019s investments in emerging market countries may involve risks greater than, or in addition to, the risks of investing in more developed countries.\\nEmerging Markets Risk.  The risks of foreign investing mentioned above are heightened when investing in emerging markets. Emerging markets securities involve a number of additional risks, which may result from less government supervision and regulation of business and industry practices (including the potential lack of strict finance and accounting controls and standards), stock exchanges, brokers, and listed companies, making these investments potentially more volatile in price and less liquid than investments in developed securities markets, resulting in greater risk to investors. There is a risk in developing countries that a future economic or political crisis could lead to price controls, forced mergers of companies, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition or enforcement of foreign ownership limits, seizure, nationalization, sanctions or imposition of restrictions by various governmental entities on investment and trading, or creation of government monopolies, any of which may have a detrimental effect on the Fund\\u2019s investments. In addition, the Fund\\u2019s investments may be denominated in foreign currencies and therefore, changes in the value of a country\\u2019s currency compared to the U.S. dollar may affect the value of the Fund\\u2019s investments. To the extent that the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of issuers in or companies of a single country or region, it is more likely to be impacted by events or conditions affecting that country or region, which could have a negative impact on the Fund\\u2019s performance. Some of the risks of investing directly in foreign and emerging market securities may be reduced when the Fund invests indirectly in foreign securities through various other investment vehicles including derivatives, which also involve other risks. As of September 30, 2017, approximately 17.7% of the Fund\\u2019s investments were in emerging markets (i.e. countries included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm).\\nSector Risk.  At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business within an economic sector. Companies in the same economic sector may be similarly affected by economic or market events, making the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that economic sector than funds that invest\\n78\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson International Opportunities Fund\\n \\n\\nmore broadly. As the Fund\\u2019s portfolio becomes more concentrated, the Fund is less able to spread risk and potentially reduce the risk of loss and volatility.\\nGeographic Concentration Risk.  To the extent the Fund invests a substantial amount of its assets in issuers located in a single country or region, the economic, political, regulatory or other developments or conditions within such country or region will generally have a greater effect on the Fund than they would on a more geographically diversified fund, which may result in greater losses and volatility.\\nMarket Risk.  The value of the Fund\\u2019s portfolio may decrease if the value of an individual company or security, or multiple companies or securities, in the portfolio decreases or if the portfolio managers\\u2019 belief about a company\\u2019s intrinsic worth is incorrect. Further, regardless of how well individual companies or securities perform, the value of the Fund\\u2019s portfolio could also decrease if there are deteriorating economic or market conditions. It is important to understand that the value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, in response to changes in the market, and you could lose money. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, economic sector, or the market as a whole.\\nSmall- and Mid-Sized Companies Risk.  The Fund\\u2019s investments in securities issued by small- and mid-sized companies, which can include smaller, start-up companies offering emerging products or services, may involve greater risks than are customarily associated with larger, more established companies. For example, while small- and mid-sized companies may realize more substantial growth than larger or more established issuers, they may also suffer more significant losses as a result of their narrow product lines, limited operating history, greater exposure to competitive threats, limited financial resources, limited trading markets, and the potential lack of management depth. Securities issued by small- and mid-sized companies tend to be more volatile and somewhat more speculative than securities issued by larger or more established companies and may underperform as compared to the securities of larger or more established companies. These holdings are also subject to wider price fluctuations and tend to be less liquid than stocks of larger or more established companies, which could have a significant adverse effect on the Fund\\u2019s returns, especially as market conditions change.\\nInitial Public Offering Risk.  The Fund\\u2019s purchase of shares issued in an initial public offering (\\u201cIPO\\u201d) exposes it to the risks associated with companies that have little operating history as public companies, as well as to the risks inherent in those sectors of the market where these new issuers operate. Although IPO investments may have had a positive impact on the Fund\\u2019s performance in the past, there can be no assurance that the Fund will identify favorable IPO investment opportunities in the future. In addition, as the Fund increases in size, the impact of IPOs on the Fund\\u2019s performance will generally decrease.\\nDerivatives Risk.  Derivatives can be highly volatile and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying referenced securities or asset. Gains or losses from a derivative investment can be substantially greater than the derivative\\u2019s original cost, and can therefore involve leverage. Leverage may cause the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not used leverage. Derivatives can be less liquid than other types of investments and entail the risk that the counterparty will default on its payment obligations. The Fund may use derivatives, including forward currency contracts, for hedging purposes. Hedging with derivatives may increase expenses, and there is no guarantee that a hedging strategy will work. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains or cause losses if the market moves in a manner different from that anticipated by the Fund or if the cost of the derivative outweighs the benefit of the hedge.\\nPortfolio Turnover Risk.  Increased portfolio turnover may result in higher costs, which may have a negative effect on the Fund\\u2019s performance. In addition, higher portfolio turnover may result in the acceleration of capital gains and the recognition of greater levels of short-term capital gains, which are taxed at ordinary federal income tax rates when distributed to shareholders.\\nSecurities Lending Risk.  The Fund may seek to earn additional income through lending its securities to certain qualified broker-dealers and institutions. There is the risk that when portfolio securities are lent, the securities may not be returned on a timely basis, and the Fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the security or gaining access to the collateral provided to the Fund to collateralize the loan. If the Fund is unable to recover a security on loan, the Fund may use the collateral to purchase replacement securities in the market. There is a risk that the value of the collateral could decrease below the cost of the replacement security by the time the replacement investment is made, resulting in a loss to the Fund.\\nManagement Risk.  The Fund is an actively managed investment portfolio and is therefore subject to the risk that the investment strategies employed for the Fund may fail to produce the intended results. The Fund may underperform its benchmark index or other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.\\n79\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson International Opportunities Fund\\n \\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nPERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\nThe following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing how the Fund\\u2019s performance has varied over time. Returns shown prior to June 5, 2017 are those of the Predecessor Fund, Henderson International Opportunities Fund. The Predecessor Fund was advised by Henderson Global Investors (North America) Inc. and subadvised by Henderson Investment Management Limited. Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class R Shares, Class I Shares, Class IF Shares and Class R6 Shares of the Predecessor Fund were reorganized into Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class R Shares, Class I Shares (Class I Shares and Class IF Shares of the Predecessor Fund were reorganized into Class I Shares of the Fund) and Class N Shares, respectively, of the Fund on June 2, 2017. Class A Shares and Class C Shares of the Predecessor Fund commenced operations with the Predecessor Fund\\u2019s inception on August 31, 2001. Class R Shares, Class I Shares, Class R6 Shares and Class IF Shares of the Predecessor Fund commenced operations on September 30, 2005, March 31, 2009, November 30, 2015 and March 31, 2016, respectively.

The bar chart figures do not include any applicable sales charges that an investor may pay when they buy or sell Class A Shares or Class C Shares of the Fund. If sales charges were included, the returns would be lower. The table compares the Fund\\u2019s average annual returns for the periods indicated to a broad-based securities market index. All figures assume reinvestment of dividends and\\n80\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson International Opportunities Fund\\n \\n\\ndistributions.

The index is described below.\\n\\u2022\\tThe MSCI EAFE\\u00ae (Europe, Australasia, Far East) Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index designed to measure developed market equity performance. The MSCI EAFE\\u00ae Index is composed of companies representative of the market structure of developed market countries.\\nPrior to June 5, 2017, the Predecessor Fund used the MSCI EAFE\\u00ae Index gross of foreign withholding taxes. Effective June 5, 2017, the Fund\\u2019s performance will be compared to the MSCI EAFE\\u00ae Index net of foreign withholding taxes because it more closely reflects the Fund\\u2019s investment universe and is consistent with the practices of other funds advised by Janus Capital.\\nAfter-tax returns are calculated using distributions for the Predecessor Fund\\u2019s Class A Shares for the period prior to June 5, 2017. If Class A Shares of the Fund had been available during periods prior to June 5, 2017, the distributions used to calculate the after-tax returns may have been different. After-tax returns are calculated using the historically highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on your individual tax situation and may differ from those shown in the preceding table. The after-tax return information shown above does not apply to Fund shares held through a tax-deferred account, such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA.\\nAfter-tax returns are only shown for Class A Shares of the Fund. After-tax returns for the other classes of Shares will vary from those shown for Class A Shares due to varying sales charges (as applicable), fees, and expenses among the classes.\\n82\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson International Opportunities Fund\\n \\n\\nMANAGEMENT\\nInvestment Adviser:  Janus Capital Management LLC\\nPortfolio Managers:  Stephen Peak is the Lead Portfolio Manager of the Fund, and has been a member of the portfolio management team of the Fund since inception and the Predecessor Fund since inception in 2001.

The annual fund operating expenses are based on expenses incurred during the Fund\\u2019s most recently completed fiscal period. You also may pay brokerage commissions on the purchase and sale of shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the table below.\\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\nManagement Fee\\t0.15%\\nDistribution and/or Service (12b-1) Fees\\tNone\\nOther Expenses (inclusive of Administration and Operating Services Fees)\\t0.15%a\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\t0.30%\\nFee Waiver\\t(0.05%)b\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses after Fee Waiver\\t0.25%\\na\\tUSAA Asset Management Company (\\u201cAMCO\\u201d or \\u201cAdviser\\u201d) has entered into an Administration and Operating Services Agreement with the Fund. Under the terms of this agreement, the Adviser has contractually agreed, in exchange for an annualized fee of 0.15% of the average daily net assets of the Fund, to provide administrative services to the Fund and to pay all operating expenses of the Fund, excluding distribution and/or service fees, taxes, brokerage commissions and transaction costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary expenses.\\nb\\tThe Adviser has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees in an amount equal to 0.05% of the average daily net assets of the Fund through December 31, 2019, and the waiver cannot be terminated or reduced without approval of the Fund\\u2019s Board of Trustees during that term.\\nExample\\nThis example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. This example does not take into account brokerage commissions that you may pay when purchasing or selling shares. This example assumes (1) a 5% annual return, (2) that the Fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same, (3) that the fee waiver is not continued beyond one year, and (4) you sell all of your shares at the end of\\nProspectus  |  9\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nthe stated period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, you would pay the following expenses on a $10,000 investment:\\n1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\n$26\\t$91\\t$164\\t$376\\nPortfolio Turnover\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, including commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when shares of the Fund are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance.\\nFrom the Fund\\u2019s commencement of operations, October 24, 2017, through the period ended August 31, 2018, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 81% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY\\nUnder normal circumstances, the Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings for investment purposes, exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in securities in the Index. MSCI, Inc. (the \\u201cIndex Provider\\u201d) constructs the Index in accordance with a rules-based methodology. The Index is comprised solely of securities issued by small capitalization companies. As of September 1, 2018, the market capitalization of the issuers in the Index ranged from $200 million to $14.8 billion. The range may change from time to time.\\nThe Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small-capitalization U.S. issuers within the MSCI USA Small Cap Index (the \\u201cParent Index\\u201d) that have higher exposure to value and momentum factors while also maintaining moderate Index turnover and lower realized volatility than traditional capitalization weighted indexes. The value factor indicates how attractively a stock is priced relative to its fundamentals, such as book value and free cash flow. A value score is derived from a company\\u2019s valuation ratios, e.g. forward price to earnings, share price to book value, and enterprise value to operating cash flow. The momentum factor indicates whether changes in a company\\u2019s share price are trending up or down. A momentum score is calculated using a security\\u2019s price trends over the last six months and twelve months (except the previous month), adjusted for volatility. A security is only evaluated within a single industry or sector. A liquidity filter is applied to screen out securities with low liquidity. Securities generally are filtered by selecting the top 90% by count of securities in the Parent Index, based on the highest 12-month annualized traded value.\\n10  |  USAA MSCI Index ETFs\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nThe Index Provider ranks each stock of the Parent Index based on its value and momentum scores, relative to their sector classification, and creates a composite score for each stock by equally weighting the stock\\u2019s value and momentum score. The Index Provider then selects the top 25% of the ranked stocks of the Parent Index based on their composite scores for inclusion in the Index. The constituents are weighted such that securities with lower realized volatility are given higher Index weights.\\nIn seeking to track the performance of the Index, the Fund may invest in a representative sample of securities in its Index, which means the Fund may hold some, but not all of the securities in the Index. The representative sample will be selected by the Adviser or SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\\u201cSubadviser\\u201d) using a sampling strategy that aims to create a portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and return characteristics as the Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors, including number of stocks in the Index and asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these factors, the Fund may invest in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the securities represented in the Index in approximately the same proportions as the Index. Thus, there may be instances in which the Fund is underweight or overweight a security in the Index.\\nThe Fund also may invest up to 20% of its assets in instruments other than the securities in the Index, which the Adviser or Subadviser believes will help the Fund track the Index. Such instruments may include derivatives, including futures.\\nThe Fund is expected to concentrate its investments (i.e., hold more than 25% of its assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to the extent that its Index is concentrated. The degree to which certain sectors, industries, or asset classes are represented in the Index may change over time. The Index will rebalance quarterly.\\nPRINCIPAL RISKS\\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk: The Fund\\u2019s shares may have a limited number of Authorized Participants, which are financial institutions that are able to purchase and redeem a large specified number of shares of the Fund in the form of \\u201cCreation Units.\\u201d To the extent they cannot or otherwise are unwilling to engage in creation and redemption transactions and no other Authorized Participant steps in, shares of the Fund may trade like closed-end fund shares at a significant discount or premium to net asset value (\\u201cNAV\\u201d) and may face trading halts and delisting from the exchange.\\nCalculation Methodology Risk: The Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund, the Index Provider, the Subadviser, nor the Adviser can offer assurances\\nProspectus  |  11\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nthat the Index\\u2019s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included issuers or correct valuation of securities, nor can they guarantee the availability or timeliness of the production of an Index.\\nConcentration Risk: In following its methodology, the Index from time to time may be concentrated to a significant degree in securities of issuers located in a single industry or sector. To the extent that the Index concentrates in the securities of issuers in a particular industry or sector, the Fund also can be expected to concentrate its investments to approximately the same extent. By concentrating its investments in an industry or sector, the Fund may face more risks than if it were diversified broadly over numerous industries or sectors. If the Index is not concentrated in a particular industry or sector, the Fund will not concentrate in a particular industry or sector.\\nDerivatives Risk: Derivatives, including swap agreements and futures contracts, may involve risks different from, or greater than, those associated with more traditional investments. As a result of investing in derivatives, the Fund could lose more than the amount it invests. Derivatives may be highly illiquid, and the Fund may not be able to close out or sell a derivative position at a particular time or at an anticipated price. Derivatives also may be subject to counterparty risk, which includes the risk that the Fund may sustain a loss as a result of the insolvency or bankruptcy of, or other non-compliance by, the other party to the transaction.\\nExchange-Traded Fund (\\u201cETF\\u201d) Risk: The Fund\\u2019s shares are traded on an exchange and are bought and sold on the secondary market at market prices. The shares may trade at a premium or discount to NAV; and as a result, investors may pay more than NAV when purchasing shares and receive less than NAV when selling shares. The Fund\\u2019s shares also face the risks of disruptions to creations and redemptions, and extreme volatility in their market price. Investors buying or selling shares in the secondary market may pay brokerage commissions, which may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of shares. The Fund\\u2019s investments in other investment companies are subject to statutory limitations prescribed by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \\u201c1940 Act\\u201d). It is possible that an active trading market for the shares will not be maintained, or that trading in the shares will be halted for reasons such as market-wide trading halts or the shares no longer meeting the listing requirements of the exchange.\\nIndex Risk: The Fund attempts to track the performance of a specific index. The Fund will be negatively affected by general declines in the securities and asset classes represented in the Index. In addition, because the Fund is not \\u201cactively\\u201d managed, unless a specific security is removed from the Index, the Fund generally would not sell a security because the security\\u2019s issuer was in financial trouble. The Fund also does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. Therefore, the Fund\\u2019s performance could be lower than funds that may actively shift their\\n12  |  USAA MSCI Index ETFs\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nportfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or to lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers.\\nLiquidity Risk: The Fund is subject to liquidity risk, which is the risk that the Fund\\u2019s investment may be difficult to purchase or sell and that an investment may not be sold or disposed of at an advantageous price or time.\\nManagement Risk: The Fund is subject to management risk, which is the possibility that the investment techniques and risk analyses used by the Fund\\u2019s portfolio managers will not produce the desired results.\\nMarket Risk: Any investment involves risk, and there is no assurance that the Fund\\u2019s investment objective will be achieved. Losing money is a risk of investing in the Fund. The value of the securities in which the Fund invests may go up or down in response to the prospects of individual companies, particular sectors or governments, and/or general economic conditions throughout the world due to increasingly interconnected global economies and financial markets, or general investor sentiment. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.\\nMomentum Risk: Momentum investing entails investing more in securities that exhibit persistence in relative performance evidenced by better recent price performance compared to other securities. These securities may be more volatile than a broad cross-section of securities, and momentum may be an indicator that a security\\u2019s price is peaking. Momentum can turn quickly and cause significant variation from other types of investments. The Fund may experience significant losses if momentum stops, turns or otherwise behaves differently than predicted.\\nSecurities Lending Risk: The Fund may lend its portfolio securities to seek income. There is a risk that a borrower may default on its obligations to return loaned securities. The Fund will be responsible for the risks associated with the investment of cash collateral, including any collateral invested in a money market fund. The Fund may lose money on its investment of cash collateral or may fail to earn sufficient income on its investment to meet obligations to the borrower. In addition, delays may occur in the recovery of securities from borrowers, which could interfere with the Fund\\u2019s ability to vote proxies or to settle transactions.\\nSeed Investor or Large Shareholder Risk: Certain large shareholders, including other funds advised by the Adviser, may from time to time own a substantial amount of the Fund\\u2019s shares. In addition, seed investors, such as the Adviser, an affiliate of the Adviser, an Authorized Participant, a lead market maker, or other entity, may contribute all or a majority of the assets in the Fund to facilitate commencement of the Fund or to facilitate the Fund\\u2019s achieving a specified size or scale. There is a risk that such large shareholders\\nProspectus  |  13\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nor seed investors may redeem their investments in the Fund, which could have a significant negative impact on the Fund\\u2019s NAV, market price, and brokerage costs.\\nSmall-Capitalization Company Risk: Investments in small-capitalization companies involve greater risks than those associated with larger, more established companies. These securities may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements and may lack sufficient market liquidity, making it difficult for a Fund to buy and sell them at the time and price desired, and these issuers often face greater business risks. Small-capitalization companies typically are less financially stable than larger, more established companies, and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them vulnerable to loss of personnel. These companies also generally have less diverse product lines than larger capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.\\nTracking Error Risk: Tracking error is the divergence of the Fund\\u2019s performance from that of the Index. The performance of the Fund may diverge from that of its Index for a number of reasons, such as the use of representative sampling, transaction costs, the Fund\\u2019s holding of cash, differences in accrual of dividends, changes to the Index, tax considerations, rebalancing, or new or existing regulatory requirements. Unlike the Fund, the returns of the Index are not reduced by investment and other operating expenses, including the trading costs associated with implementing changes to its portfolio of investments. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of market volatility or other unusual market conditions. To the extent that the Fund calculates its NAV based on fair value prices and the value of the Index is based on securities\\u2019 closing prices (i.e., the value of the Index is not based on fair value prices), the Fund\\u2019s ability to track the Index may be adversely affected. For tax efficiency purposes, the Fund may sell certain securities to realize losses, which will result in a deviation from the Index.\\nValuation Risk: The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund\\u2019s valuation of the security and may differ from the value used by the Index, particularly for securities that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. The Fund relies on various sources to calculate its NAV. The information may be provided by third parties that are believed to be reliable, but the information may not be accurate due to errors by such pricing sources, technological issues, or otherwise.\\nValue Risk: Value investing entails investing in securities that are inexpensive relative to other securities based on ratios such as price to earnings or price to book. There may be periods when value investing is out of favor, and during which the investment performance of a fund using a value strategy may suffer. In addition, value stocks are subject to the risk that their intrinsic value may never be realized in the market.\\n14  |  USAA MSCI Index ETFs\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit in USAA Federal Savings Bank, or any other bank, and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nPERFORMANCE\\nPerformance history for the Fund will be available in the prospectus after the Fund has been in operation for one full calendar year.

Shares of the Fund are listed and traded on NYSE Arca, Inc. The price you pay or receive for shares will be the prevailing market price, which may be more or less than the NAV of the shares. The Fund will issue and redeem shares at NAV only to certain authorized participants and only in a large block of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each block of 50,000 shares is a Creation Unit. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, the shares are not redeemable securities of the Fund. Most investors will incur customary brokerage commissions and charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer.\\nTAX INFORMATION\\nThe Fund intends to make distributions that are taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account.\\nPAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES\\nIf you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of such shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment.

The annual fund operating expenses are based on expenses incurred during the Fund\\u2019s most recently completed fiscal period. You also may pay brokerage commissions on the purchase and sale of shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the table below.\\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\nManagement Fee\\t0.15%\\nDistribution and/or Service (12b-1) Fees\\tNone\\nOther Expenses (inclusive of Administration and Operating Services Fees)\\t0.15%a\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\t0.30%\\nFee Waiver\\t(0.05%)b\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses after Fee Waiver\\t0.25%\\na\\tUSAA Asset Management Company (\\u201cAMCO\\u201d or \\u201cAdviser\\u201d) has entered into an Administration and Operating Services Agreement with the Fund. Under the terms of this agreement, the Adviser has contractually agreed, in exchange for an annualized fee of 0.15% of the average daily net assets of the Fund, to provide administrative services to the Fund and to pay all operating expenses of the Fund, excluding distribution and/or service fees, taxes, brokerage commissions and transaction costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary expenses.\\nb\\tThe Adviser has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees in an amount equal to 0.05% of the average daily net assets of the Fund through December 31, 2019, and the waiver cannot be terminated or reduced without approval of the Fund\\u2019s Board of Trustees during that term.\\nExample\\nThis example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. This example does not take into account brokerage commissions that you may pay when purchasing or selling shares. This example assumes (1) a 5% annual return, (2) that the Fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same, (3) that the fee waiver is not continued beyond one year, and (4) you sell all of your shares at the end of\\nProspectus  |  9\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nthe stated period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, you would pay the following expenses on a $10,000 investment:\\n1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\n$26\\t$91\\t$164\\t$376\\nPortfolio Turnover\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, including commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when shares of the Fund are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance.\\nFrom the Fund\\u2019s commencement of operations, October 24, 2017, through the period ended August 31, 2018, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 81% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY\\nUnder normal circumstances, the Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings for investment purposes, exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in securities in the Index. MSCI, Inc. (the \\u201cIndex Provider\\u201d) constructs the Index in accordance with a rules-based methodology. The Index is comprised solely of securities issued by small capitalization companies. As of September 1, 2018, the market capitalization of the issuers in the Index ranged from $200 million to $14.8 billion. The range may change from time to time.\\nThe Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small-capitalization U.S. issuers within the MSCI USA Small Cap Index (the \\u201cParent Index\\u201d) that have higher exposure to value and momentum factors while also maintaining moderate Index turnover and lower realized volatility than traditional capitalization weighted indexes. The value factor indicates how attractively a stock is priced relative to its fundamentals, such as book value and free cash flow. A value score is derived from a company\\u2019s valuation ratios, e.g. forward price to earnings, share price to book value, and enterprise value to operating cash flow. The momentum factor indicates whether changes in a company\\u2019s share price are trending up or down. A momentum score is calculated using a security\\u2019s price trends over the last six months and twelve months (except the previous month), adjusted for volatility. A security is only evaluated within a single industry or sector. A liquidity filter is applied to screen out securities with low liquidity. Securities generally are filtered by selecting the top 90% by count of securities in the Parent Index, based on the highest 12-month annualized traded value.\\n10  |  USAA MSCI Index ETFs\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nThe Index Provider ranks each stock of the Parent Index based on its value and momentum scores, relative to their sector classification, and creates a composite score for each stock by equally weighting the stock\\u2019s value and momentum score. The Index Provider then selects the top 25% of the ranked stocks of the Parent Index based on their composite scores for inclusion in the Index. The constituents are weighted such that securities with lower realized volatility are given higher Index weights.\\nIn seeking to track the performance of the Index, the Fund may invest in a representative sample of securities in its Index, which means the Fund may hold some, but not all of the securities in the Index. The representative sample will be selected by the Adviser or SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (\\u201cSubadviser\\u201d) using a sampling strategy that aims to create a portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and return characteristics as the Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors, including number of stocks in the Index and asset size of the Fund. Based on its analysis of these factors, the Fund may invest in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest the Fund's assets in substantially all of the securities represented in the Index in approximately the same proportions as the Index. Thus, there may be instances in which the Fund is underweight or overweight a security in the Index.\\nThe Fund also may invest up to 20% of its assets in instruments other than the securities in the Index, which the Adviser or Subadviser believes will help the Fund track the Index. Such instruments may include derivatives, including futures.\\nThe Fund is expected to concentrate its investments (i.e., hold more than 25% of its assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to the extent that its Index is concentrated. The degree to which certain sectors, industries, or asset classes are represented in the Index may change over time. The Index will rebalance quarterly.\\nPRINCIPAL RISKS\\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk: The Fund\\u2019s shares may have a limited number of Authorized Participants, which are financial institutions that are able to purchase and redeem a large specified number of shares of the Fund in the form of \\u201cCreation Units.\\u201d To the extent they cannot or otherwise are unwilling to engage in creation and redemption transactions and no other Authorized Participant steps in, shares of the Fund may trade like closed-end fund shares at a significant discount or premium to net asset value (\\u201cNAV\\u201d) and may face trading halts and delisting from the exchange.\\nCalculation Methodology Risk: The Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund, the Index Provider, the Subadviser, nor the Adviser can offer assurances\\nProspectus  |  11\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nthat the Index\\u2019s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included issuers or correct valuation of securities, nor can they guarantee the availability or timeliness of the production of an Index.\\nConcentration Risk: In following its methodology, the Index from time to time may be concentrated to a significant degree in securities of issuers located in a single industry or sector. To the extent that the Index concentrates in the securities of issuers in a particular industry or sector, the Fund also can be expected to concentrate its investments to approximately the same extent. By concentrating its investments in an industry or sector, the Fund may face more risks than if it were diversified broadly over numerous industries or sectors. If the Index is not concentrated in a particular industry or sector, the Fund will not concentrate in a particular industry or sector.\\nDerivatives Risk: Derivatives, including swap agreements and futures contracts, may involve risks different from, or greater than, those associated with more traditional investments. As a result of investing in derivatives, the Fund could lose more than the amount it invests. Derivatives may be highly illiquid, and the Fund may not be able to close out or sell a derivative position at a particular time or at an anticipated price. Derivatives also may be subject to counterparty risk, which includes the risk that the Fund may sustain a loss as a result of the insolvency or bankruptcy of, or other non-compliance by, the other party to the transaction.\\nExchange-Traded Fund (\\u201cETF\\u201d) Risk: The Fund\\u2019s shares are traded on an exchange and are bought and sold on the secondary market at market prices. The shares may trade at a premium or discount to NAV; and as a result, investors may pay more than NAV when purchasing shares and receive less than NAV when selling shares. The Fund\\u2019s shares also face the risks of disruptions to creations and redemptions, and extreme volatility in their market price. Investors buying or selling shares in the secondary market may pay brokerage commissions, which may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of shares. The Fund\\u2019s investments in other investment companies are subject to statutory limitations prescribed by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \\u201c1940 Act\\u201d). It is possible that an active trading market for the shares will not be maintained, or that trading in the shares will be halted for reasons such as market-wide trading halts or the shares no longer meeting the listing requirements of the exchange.\\nIndex Risk: The Fund attempts to track the performance of a specific index. The Fund will be negatively affected by general declines in the securities and asset classes represented in the Index. In addition, because the Fund is not \\u201cactively\\u201d managed, unless a specific security is removed from the Index, the Fund generally would not sell a security because the security\\u2019s issuer was in financial trouble. The Fund also does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. Therefore, the Fund\\u2019s performance could be lower than funds that may actively shift their\\n12  |  USAA MSCI Index ETFs\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nportfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or to lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers.\\nLiquidity Risk: The Fund is subject to liquidity risk, which is the risk that the Fund\\u2019s investment may be difficult to purchase or sell and that an investment may not be sold or disposed of at an advantageous price or time.\\nManagement Risk: The Fund is subject to management risk, which is the possibility that the investment techniques and risk analyses used by the Fund\\u2019s portfolio managers will not produce the desired results.\\nMarket Risk: Any investment involves risk, and there is no assurance that the Fund\\u2019s investment objective will be achieved. Losing money is a risk of investing in the Fund. The value of the securities in which the Fund invests may go up or down in response to the prospects of individual companies, particular sectors or governments, and/or general economic conditions throughout the world due to increasingly interconnected global economies and financial markets, or general investor sentiment. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.\\nMomentum Risk: Momentum investing entails investing more in securities that exhibit persistence in relative performance evidenced by better recent price performance compared to other securities. These securities may be more volatile than a broad cross-section of securities, and momentum may be an indicator that a security\\u2019s price is peaking. Momentum can turn quickly and cause significant variation from other types of investments. The Fund may experience significant losses if momentum stops, turns or otherwise behaves differently than predicted.\\nSecurities Lending Risk: The Fund may lend its portfolio securities to seek income. There is a risk that a borrower may default on its obligations to return loaned securities. The Fund will be responsible for the risks associated with the investment of cash collateral, including any collateral invested in a money market fund. The Fund may lose money on its investment of cash collateral or may fail to earn sufficient income on its investment to meet obligations to the borrower. In addition, delays may occur in the recovery of securities from borrowers, which could interfere with the Fund\\u2019s ability to vote proxies or to settle transactions.\\nSeed Investor or Large Shareholder Risk: Certain large shareholders, including other funds advised by the Adviser, may from time to time own a substantial amount of the Fund\\u2019s shares. In addition, seed investors, such as the Adviser, an affiliate of the Adviser, an Authorized Participant, a lead market maker, or other entity, may contribute all or a majority of the assets in the Fund to facilitate commencement of the Fund or to facilitate the Fund\\u2019s achieving a specified size or scale. There is a risk that such large shareholders\\nProspectus  |  13\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nor seed investors may redeem their investments in the Fund, which could have a significant negative impact on the Fund\\u2019s NAV, market price, and brokerage costs.\\nSmall-Capitalization Company Risk: Investments in small-capitalization companies involve greater risks than those associated with larger, more established companies. These securities may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements and may lack sufficient market liquidity, making it difficult for a Fund to buy and sell them at the time and price desired, and these issuers often face greater business risks. Small-capitalization companies typically are less financially stable than larger, more established companies, and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them vulnerable to loss of personnel. These companies also generally have less diverse product lines than larger capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.\\nTracking Error Risk: Tracking error is the divergence of the Fund\\u2019s performance from that of the Index. The performance of the Fund may diverge from that of its Index for a number of reasons, such as the use of representative sampling, transaction costs, the Fund\\u2019s holding of cash, differences in accrual of dividends, changes to the Index, tax considerations, rebalancing, or new or existing regulatory requirements. Unlike the Fund, the returns of the Index are not reduced by investment and other operating expenses, including the trading costs associated with implementing changes to its portfolio of investments. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of market volatility or other unusual market conditions. To the extent that the Fund calculates its NAV based on fair value prices and the value of the Index is based on securities\\u2019 closing prices (i.e., the value of the Index is not based on fair value prices), the Fund\\u2019s ability to track the Index may be adversely affected. For tax efficiency purposes, the Fund may sell certain securities to realize losses, which will result in a deviation from the Index.\\nValuation Risk: The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund\\u2019s valuation of the security and may differ from the value used by the Index, particularly for securities that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. The Fund relies on various sources to calculate its NAV. The information may be provided by third parties that are believed to be reliable, but the information may not be accurate due to errors by such pricing sources, technological issues, or otherwise.\\nValue Risk: Value investing entails investing in securities that are inexpensive relative to other securities based on ratios such as price to earnings or price to book. There may be periods when value investing is out of favor, and during which the investment performance of a fund using a value strategy may suffer. In addition, value stocks are subject to the risk that their intrinsic value may never be realized in the market.\\n14  |  USAA MSCI Index ETFs\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit in USAA Federal Savings Bank, or any other bank, and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nPERFORMANCE\\nPerformance history for the Fund will be available in the prospectus after the Fund has been in operation for one full calendar year.

Shares of the Fund are listed and traded on NYSE Arca, Inc. The price you pay or receive for shares will be the prevailing market price, which may be more or less than the NAV of the shares. The Fund will issue and redeem shares at NAV only to certain authorized participants and only in a large block of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof. Each block of 50,000 shares is a Creation Unit. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, the shares are not redeemable securities of the Fund. Most investors will incur customary brokerage commissions and charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer.\\nTAX INFORMATION\\nThe Fund intends to make distributions that are taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account.\\nPAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES\\nIf you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of such shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment.

They illustrate the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you were to invest $10,000 in the Fund\\u2019s shares. These examples assume that the shares provide a return of 5% each year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table. You would incur these hypothetical expenses whether or not you redeem your investment at the end of the given period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nInvestor Shares\\t$22\\t$68\\t$118\\t$268\\nAdmiral Shares\\t$11\\t$35\\t$62\\t$141\\n \\n\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense examples, reduce the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 620% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) pass-through certificates, which are fixed income securities representing part ownership in a pool of mortgage loans supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The balance of the Fund\\u2019s assets may be invested in other types of securities, such as U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government agency securities, including pass-through certificates, as well as in repurchase agreements collateralized by such securities. Securities issued by most U.S. government agencies, other than the U.S. Treasury and GNMA, are neither guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury nor supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The Fund\\u2019s dollar-weighted average maturity depends on homeowner prepayments of the underlying mortgages. Although the Fund does not observe specific maturity guidelines, its dollar-weighted average maturity will normally fall within an intermediate-term range (3 to 10 years).\\n\\n29\\n\\n \\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Prepayment risk, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, homeowners will refinance their mortgages before their maturity dates, resulting in prepayment of mortgage-backed securities held by the Fund. The Fund would then lose any price appreciation above the mortgage\\u2019s principal and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the Fund\\u2019s income. Such prepayments and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate. Prepayment risk is high for the Fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Extension risk, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, homeowners will repay their mortgages at slower rates. This will lengthen the duration or average life of mortgage-backed securities held by the Fund and delay the Fund\\u2019s ability to reinvest proceeds at higher interest rates. Extension risk is high for the Fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Income risk, which is the chance that the Fund\\u2019s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the Fund\\u2019s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.\\n\\n\\u2022 Interest rate risk, which is the chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. In addition, when interest rates decline, GNMA prices typically do not rise as much as the prices of comparable bonds. This is because the market tends to discount GNMA prices for prepayment risk when interest rates decline. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the Fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Manager risk, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the Fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.\\n\\n\\u2022 Derivatives risk. The Fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\n30\\n\\n \\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Fund\\u2018s Investor Shares has varied from one calendar year to another over the periods shown. The table shows how the average annual total returns of the share classes presented compare with those of a relevant market index, which has investment characteristics similar to those of the Fund.

The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 5% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies\\n\\nUnder normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its assets in investment grade \\u201cMassachusetts municipal securities\\u201d or other investments with similar economic characteristics. Massachusetts municipal securities are securities the interest on which is exempt from regular federal income tax and Massachusetts state personal income taxes. The fund\\u2019s 80% policy may not be changed without a shareholder vote. Interest on Massachusetts municipal securities may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.\\n\\nMassachusetts municipal securities include debt obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its political subdivisions, agencies and public authorities, certain other governmental issuers (such as Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam) and other qualifying issuers. These securities include participation or other interests in municipal securities issued or backed by banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions.\\n\\nSome municipal securities, such as general obligation issues, are backed by the issuer\\u2019s taxing authority, while other municipal securities, such as revenue issues, are backed only by revenues from certain facilities or other sources and not by the issuer itself.\\n\\nThe fund focuses on investment grade bonds (that is, securities rated in the Baa/BBB categories or above or, if unrated, determined to be of comparable credit quality by the subadviser) but may invest up to 20% of its assets in below investment grade bonds (commonly known as \\u201chigh yield\\u201d or \\u201cjunk\\u201d bonds).\\n\\nThe fund may invest in securities of any maturity. The fund focuses primarily on intermediate-term and long-term municipal securities, and will normally invest in securities which have remaining maturities at the time of purchase from one to more than thirty years.\\n\\nThe fund may also invest in securities of other open-end or closed-end investment companies, including exchange-traded funds (\\u201cETFs\\u201d), that invest primarily in municipal securities.\\n\\nInstead of, and/or in addition to, investing directly in particular securities, the fund may use instruments such as derivatives, including options, futures contracts and inverse floating rate instruments issued in tender option bond transactions, and other synthetic instruments that are intended to provide economic exposure to the securities or the issuer or to be used as a hedging technique. The fund may use one or more types of these instruments without limit, except that these instruments are taken into account when determining compliance with the fund\\u2019s 80% policy. For additional information regarding derivatives, see \\u201cMore on the fund\\u2019s investment strategies, investments and risks\\u2014Derivatives\\u201d in this Prospectus.\\n\\nThe fund may also engage in a variety of transactions using derivatives in order to change the investment characteristics of its portfolio (such as shortening or lengthening duration) and for other purposes. The fund may leverage its assets by investing proceeds received through tender option\\n\\n \\n\\nWestern Asset Massachusetts Municipals Fund\\t \\t3\\nTable of Contents\\nbond transactions, which is considered a form of borrowing. See \\u201cMore on the fund\\u2019s investment strategies, investments and risks\\u2014Tender option bonds\\u201d in this Prospectus.\\n\\nThe fund is classified as \\u201cnon-diversified,\\u201d which means it may invest a larger percentage of its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund.\\n\\nPrincipal risks\\n\\nRisk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly. You may lose part or all of your investment in the fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any bank or government agency. The following is a summary description of certain risks of investing in the fund.\\n\\nMarket and interest rate risk. The value of the fund\\u2019s securities may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to general market conditions, such as real or perceived adverse economic or political conditions, inflation, changes in interest rates, lack of liquidity in the bond markets or adverse investor sentiment. If the value of the securities owned by the fund falls, the value of your investment will decline. The value of your investment will generally go down when interest rates rise. A rise in rates tends to have a greater impact on the prices of longer term or duration securities. Interest rates have been historically low, so the fund faces a heightened risk that interest rates may rise. A general rise in interest rates may cause investors to move out of fixed income securities on a large scale, which could adversely affect the price and liquidity of fixed income securities and could also result in increased redemptions from the fund.\\n\\nThe maturity of a security may be significantly longer than its duration. A security\\u2019s maturity and other features may be more relevant than its duration in determining the security\\u2019s sensitivity to other factors affecting the issuer or markets generally such as changes in credit quality or in the yield premium that the market may establish for certain types of securities.\\n\\nMarket events risk. In the past decade financial markets throughout the world have experienced increased volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity and heightened uncertainty. Governmental and non-governmental issuers have defaulted on, or been forced to restructure, their debts. These conditions may continue, recur, worsen or spread. Events that have contributed to these market conditions include, but are not limited to, major cybersecurity events; geopolitical events (including wars and terror attacks); measures to address budget deficits; downgrading of sovereign debt; declines in oil and commodity prices; dramatic changes in currency exchange rates; and public sentiment.\\n\\nThe U.S. government and the Federal Reserve, as well as certain foreign governments and central banks, have taken steps to support financial markets, including by keeping interest rates at historically low levels. This and other government intervention may not work as intended, particularly if the efforts are perceived by investors as being unlikely to achieve the desired results. The Federal Reserve has reduced its market support activities and recently has begun raising interest rates. Certain foreign governments and central banks are implementing or discussing so-called negative interest rates (e.g., charging depositors who keep their cash at a bank) to spur economic growth. Further Federal Reserve or other U.S. or non-U.S. governmental or central bank actions, including interest rate increases or contrary actions by different governments, could negatively affect financial markets generally, increase market volatility and reduce the value and liquidity of securities in which the fund invests.\\n\\nPolicy and legislative changes in the United States and in other countries are affecting many aspects of financial regulation and may in some instances contribute to decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the financial markets. The impact of these changes on the markets, and the practical implications for market participants, may not be fully known for some time.\\n\\nEconomies and financial markets throughout the world are increasingly interconnected. Economic, financial or political events, trading and tariff arrangements, terrorism, natural disasters and other circumstances in one country or region could have profound impacts on global economies or markets. As a result, whether or not the fund invests in securities of issuers located in or with significant exposure to the countries directly affected, the value and liquidity of the fund\\u2019s investments may be negatively affected.\\n\\nCredit risk. If an issuer or guarantor of a security held by the fund or a counterparty to a financial contract with the fund defaults or is downgraded, or is perceived to be less creditworthy, or if the value of the assets underlying a security declines, the value of your investment will typically decline. Subordinated securities are more likely to suffer a credit loss than non-subordinated securities of the same issuer and will be disproportionately affected by a default, downgrade or perceived decline in creditworthiness.\\n\\nHigh yield (\\u201cjunk\\u201d) bonds risk. High yield bonds are generally subject to greater credit risks than higher-grade bonds, including the risk of default on the payment of interest or principal. High yield bonds are considered speculative, tend to be less liquid and are more difficult to value than higher grade securities. High yield bonds tend to be volatile and more susceptible to adverse events, credit downgrades and negative sentiments and may be difficult to sell at a desired price, or at all, during periods of uncertainty or market turmoil.\\n\\nDerivatives risk. Using derivatives can increase fund losses and reduce opportunities for gains when market prices, interest rates or the derivatives themselves, behave in a way not anticipated by the fund. Using derivatives also can have a leveraging effect and increase fund volatility. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult to sell, unwind or value, and the counterparty may default on its obligations to the fund. Derivatives are generally subject to the risks applicable to the assets, rates, indices or other indicators underlying the derivative. The value of a derivative may fluctuate more than the underlying assets, rates, indices or other indicators to which it relates. Use of derivatives may have different tax consequences for the fund than an investment in the underlying security, and\\n\\n \\n\\n4\\t  \\tWestern Asset Massachusetts Municipals Fund\\nTable of Contents\\nthose differences may affect the amount, timing and character of income distributed to shareholders, including the proportion of income consisting of exempt-interest dividends. The U.S. government and foreign governments are in the process of adopting and implementing regulations governing derivatives markets, including mandatory clearing of certain derivatives, margin and reporting requirements. The ultimate impact of the regulations remains unclear. Additional regulation of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, limit their availability or utility, otherwise adversely affect their performance or disrupt markets.\\n\\nLeveraging risk. The value of your investment may be more volatile if the fund borrows or uses derivatives or other investments that have a leveraging effect on the fund\\u2019s portfolio. Other risks described in the Prospectus also will be compounded because leverage generally magnifies the effect of a change in the value of an asset and creates a risk of loss of value on a larger pool of assets than the fund would otherwise have had. The fund may also have to sell assets at inopportune times to satisfy its obligations. The use of leverage is considered to be a speculative investment practice and may result in the loss of a substantial amount, and possibly all, of the fund\\u2019s assets.\\n\\nTender option bond risk. Tender option bond transactions expose the fund to leverage and credit risk, and generally involve greater risk than investments in fixed rate municipal bonds, including the risk of loss of principal. The interest payments that the fund would typically receive on inverse floating rate debt instruments (\\u201cinverse floaters\\u201d) acquired in such transactions vary inversely with short-term interest rates and will be reduced (and potentially eliminated) when short-term interest rates increase. In addition, the risk of leverage will be increased to the extent that the fund invests the proceeds that it receives from the sale of floating rate securities in a tender option bond transaction in other securities. Inverse floaters will generally underperform the market for fixed rate municipal securities when interest rates rise. The value and market for inverse floaters can be volatile, and inverse floaters can have limited liquidity. Investments in inverse floaters issued in tender option bond transactions are derivative instruments and, therefore, are also subject to the risks generally applicable to investments in derivatives.\\n\\nLiquidity risk. Some assets held by the fund may be impossible or difficult to sell, particularly during times of market turmoil. These illiquid assets may also be difficult to value. Markets may become illiquid when, for instance, there are few, if any, interested buyers or sellers or when dealers are unwilling or unable to make a market for certain securities. As a general matter, dealers recently have been less willing to make markets for fixed income securities. If the fund is forced to sell an illiquid asset to meet redemption requests or other cash needs, the fund may be forced to sell at a loss. The fund may not receive its proceeds from the sale of certain securities for an extended period (for example, several weeks or even longer).\\n\\nTax risk. The income on the fund\\u2019s municipal securities could become subject to regular federal income tax or Massachusetts state personal income taxes due to noncompliant conduct by issuers, unfavorable legislation or litigation or adverse interpretations by regulatory authorities. All or a portion of the fund\\u2019s dividends that are exempt from regular federal income tax may nevertheless be taken into account for purposes of federal alternative minimum tax.\\n\\nPrepayment or call risk. Many issuers have a right to prepay their fixed income securities. Issuers may be more likely to prepay their securities if interest rates fall. If this happens, the fund will not benefit from the rise in the market price of the securities that normally accompanies a decline in interest rates, and will be forced to reinvest prepayment proceeds at a time when yields on securities available in the market are lower than the yield on prepaid securities. The fund may also lose any premium it paid on prepaid securities.\\n\\nExtension risk. If interest rates rise, repayments of fixed income securities may occur more slowly than anticipated by the market. This may drive the prices of these securities down because their interest rates are lower than the current interest rate and they remain outstanding longer.\\n\\nNon-diversification risk. The fund is classified as \\u201cnon-diversified,\\u201d which means it may invest a larger percentage of its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. To the extent the fund invests its assets in a smaller number of issuers, the fund will be more susceptible to negative events affecting those issuers than a diversified fund.\\n\\nRisks relating to investments in municipal securities. Municipal issuers may be adversely affected by rising health care costs, increasing unfunded pension liabilities, and by the phasing out of federal programs providing financial support. Unfavorable conditions and developments relating to projects financed with municipal securities can result in lower revenues to issuers of municipal securities, potentially resulting in defaults. The value of municipal securities can also be adversely affected by changes in the financial condition of one or more individual municipal issuers or insurers of municipal issuers, regulatory and political developments, tax law changes or other legislative actions, and by uncertainties and public perceptions concerning these and other factors. In recent periods an increasing number of municipal issuers have defaulted on obligations, been downgraded or commenced insolvency proceedings. Financial difficulties of municipal issuers may continue or worsen.\\n\\nRisks associated with focusing on investments in Massachusetts municipal securities. The fund focuses its investments in Massachusetts municipal securities. The fund may be affected significantly by adverse economic, political or other events affecting Massachusetts municipal issuers. Also, the fund may be more volatile than a more geographically diverse fund.\\n\\nInvestment company and ETF risk. Investing in securities issued by investment companies, including ETFs, involves risks similar to those of investing directly in the securities and other assets held by the investment company or ETF. Unlike shares of typical mutual funds, shares of ETFs are traded on an exchange throughout a trading day and bought and sold based on market values and not at net asset value. For this reason, shares could trade at either a premium or discount to net asset value. The trading price of an ETF is expected to closely track the actual net asset value of the ETF, and the fund will generally gain or lose value consistent with the performance of the ETF\\u2019s portfolio securities. The fund will pay brokerage commissions in connection with the purchase and sale of shares of ETFs. In addition, the fund will indirectly bear its pro rata share of the fees and expenses incurred by a fund it invests in, including advisory fees. These expenses are in addition to the advisory and other expenses that the fund\\n\\n \\n\\nWestern Asset Massachusetts Municipals Fund\\t \\t5\\nTable of Contents\\nbears directly in connection with its own operations. An ETF may not replicate exactly the performance of the benchmark index it seeks to track for a number of reasons, including transaction costs incurred by the ETF, the temporary unavailability of certain index securities in the secondary market or discrepancies between the ETF and the index with respect to the weighting of securities or the number of securities held.\\n\\nValuation risk. The sales price the fund could receive for any particular portfolio investment may differ from the fund\\u2019s valuation of the investment, particularly for securities that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. Investors who purchase or redeem fund shares on days when the fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares or lower or higher redemption proceeds than they would have received if the fund had not fair-valued securities or had used a different valuation methodology. The fund\\u2019s ability to value its investments may be impacted by technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other third party service providers.\\n\\nPortfolio management risk. The value of your investment may decrease if the subadviser\\u2019s judgment about the quality, relative yield, value or market trends affecting a particular security, industry, sector or region, or about interest rates, is incorrect, or if there are imperfections, errors or limitations in the tools and data used by the subadviser. In addition, the fund\\u2019s investment strategies or policies may change from time to time. Those changes may not lead to the results intended by the subadviser and could have an adverse effect on the value or performance of the fund.\\n\\nRedemption risk. The fund may experience heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\\n\\nCybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity incidents may allow an unauthorized party to gain access to fund assets, customer data (including private shareholder information), or proprietary information, or cause the fund, the manager, the subadviser and/or their service providers (including, but not limited to, fund accountants, custodians, sub-custodians, transfer agents and financial intermediaries) to suffer data breaches, data corruption or loss of operational functionality.\\n\\nThese and other risks are discussed in more detail in the Prospectus or in the Statement of Additional Information.\\n\\n \\n\\n6\\t  \\tWestern Asset Massachusetts Municipals Fund\\nTable of Contents\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe accompanying bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund.

The table does not reflect any fees or expenses imposed by your Contract or Qualified Plan, which are disclosed in your separate Contract prospectus or Qualified Plan disclosure documents. If the additional fees or expenses were reflected, the expenses set forth below would be higher.\\n    \\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\n \\tClass 1\\tClass 2\\tClass 3\\nManagement fees\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\nDistribution and/or service (12b-1) fees\\t0.00%\\t0.25%\\t0.13%\\nOther expenses(a)\\t0.18%\\t0.18%\\t0.18%\\nTotal annual Fund operating expenses\\t1.05%\\t1.30%\\t1.18%\\n(a)\\tOther expenses have been restated to reflect current fees paid by the Fund.\\nExample\\nThe following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over the time periods indicated, and assumes that:\\n\\u25a0\\tyou invest $10,000 in the applicable class of Fund shares for the periods indicated,\\n\\u25a0\\tyour investment has a 5% return each year, and\\n\\u25a0\\tthe Fund\\u2019s total annual operating expenses remain the same as shown in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses table above.\\nThe example does not reflect any fees and expenses that apply to your Contract or Qualified Plan. Inclusion of these charges would increase expenses for all periods shown.\\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on the assumptions listed above, your costs would be:\\n    \\n \\t1 year\\t3 years\\t5 years\\t10 years\\nClass 1 (whether or not shares are redeemed)\\t$107\\t$334\\t$579\\t$1,283\\nClass 2 (whether or not shares are redeemed)\\t$132\\t$412\\t$713\\t$1,568\\nClass 3 (whether or not shares are redeemed)\\t$120\\t$375\\t$649\\t$1,432\\nPortfolio Turnover\\nThe Fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 23% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\nUnder normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of smaller capitalization issuers. These companies have market capitalizations in the range of companies in the Russell 2000\\u00ae Value Index (the Index) at the time of purchase\\n98\\tPROSPECTUS 2018\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS\\nSUMMARY OF COLUMBIA VP \\u2013 SELECT SMALLER-CAP VALUE FUND (continued)\\n(between $4.5 million and $8.0 billion as of March 31, 2018). The market capitalization range and composition of the companies in the Index are subject to change. The Fund\\u2019s Board of Trustees may change the parameters by which smaller market capitalization is defined if it concludes such a change is appropriate.\\nThe Fund invests substantially in securities of U.S. issuers. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign investments. The Fund also invests substantially in \\u201cvalue\\u201d companies. The Fund considers \\u201cvalue\\u201d companies to be those companies believed by the investment manager to be undervalued, either historically, by the market, or as compared with issuers in the same or similar industry or sector. The Fund may from time to time emphasize one or more sectors in selecting its investments, including the financial services sector and the information technology and technology-related sectors. The Fund also may invest in real estate investment trusts. The Fund may hold a small number of securities, consistent with its value investment approach. Generally, the Fund anticipates holding between 40 and 50 securities in its portfolio; however, the Fund may hold, at any time, more or fewer securities than noted in this range.\\nPrincipal Risks\\nAn investment in the Fund involves risks, including those described below. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective and you may lose money. The value of the Fund\\u2019s holdings may decline, and the Fund\\u2019s net asset value (NAV) and share price may go down. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nActive Management Risk. Due to its active management, the Fund could underperform its benchmark index and/or other funds with similar investment objectives and/or strategies.\\nFocused Portfolio Risk. Because the Fund may invest in a limited number of companies, the Fund as a whole is subject to greater risk of loss if any of those securities decline in price.\\nForeign Securities Risk. Investments in or exposure to foreign securities involve certain risks not associated with investments in or exposure to securities of U.S. companies. Foreign securities subject the Fund to the risks associated with investing in the particular country of an issuer, including political, regulatory, economic, social, diplomatic and other conditions or events (including, for example, military confrontations, war and terrorism), occurring in the country or region, as well as risks associated with less developed custody and settlement practices. Foreign securities may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of U.S. companies, and are subject to the risks associated with potential imposition of economic and other sanctions against a particular foreign country, its nationals or industries or businesses within the country. In addition, foreign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on the Fund\\u2019s income, capital gains or proceeds from the disposition of foreign securities, which could reduce the Fund\\u2019s return on such securities. The performance of the Fund may also be negatively affected by fluctuations in a foreign currency's strength or weakness relative to the U.S. dollar, particularly to the extent the Fund invests a significant percentage of its assets in foreign securities or other assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\\nIssuer Risk. An issuer in which the Fund invests or to which it has exposure may perform poorly, and the value of its securities may therefore decline, which would negatively affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, breakthroughs in technology, reliance on suppliers, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, natural disasters or other events, conditions or factors.\\nMarket Risk. Market risk refers to the possibility that the market values of securities or other investments that the Fund holds will fall, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, or fail to rise. An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods.\\nReal Estate-Related Investment Risk. Investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and in securities of other companies (wherever organized) principally engaged in the real estate industry subject the Fund to, among other things, risks similar to those of direct investments in real estate and the real estate industry in general. These include risks related to general and local economic conditions, possible lack of availability of financing and changes in interest rates or property values. REITs are entities that either own properties or make construction or mortgage loans, and also may include operating or finance companies. The value of interests in a REIT may be affected by,\\nPROSPECTUS 2018\\t99\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS\\nSUMMARY OF COLUMBIA VP \\u2013 SELECT SMALLER-CAP VALUE FUND (continued)\\namong other factors, changes in the value of the underlying properties owned by the REIT, changes in the prospect for earnings and/or cash flow growth of the REIT itself, defaults by borrowers or tenants, market saturation, decreases in market rates for rents, and other economic, political, or regulatory matters affecting the real estate industry, including REITs. REITs and similar non-U.S. entities depend upon specialized management skills, may have limited financial resources, may have less trading volume in their securities, and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than the overall securities markets. REITs are also subject to the risk of failing to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Some REITs (especially mortgage REITs) are affected by risks similar to those associated with investments in debt securities including changes in interest rates and the quality of credit extended.\\nSector Risk. At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business in a related group of industries within a sector, including the financial services sector and the information technology and technology-related sectors. Companies in the same sector may be similarly affected by economic, regulatory, political or market events or conditions, which may make the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that sector than funds that invest more broadly. Generally, the more broadly the Fund invests, the more it spreads risk and potentially reduces the risks of loss and volatility.\\nFinancial Services Sector. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the financial services sector than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the financial services sector are subject to certain risks, including the risk of regulatory change, decreased liquidity in credit markets and unstable interest rates. Such companies may have concentrated portfolios, such as a high level of loans to real estate developers, which makes them vulnerable to economic conditions that affect that industry. Performance of such companies may be affected by competitive pressures and exposure to investments or agreements that, under certain circumstances, may lead to losses (e.g., subprime loans). Companies in the financial services sector are subject to extensive governmental regulation that may limit the amount and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make, and interest rates and fees that they may charge. In addition, profitability of such companies is largely dependent upon the availability and the cost of capital.\\nInformation Technology and Technology-Related Sectors. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the information technology sector, as well as other technology-related sectors (collectively, the technology sectors) than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the technology sectors are subject to certain risks, including the risk that new services, equipment or technologies will not be accepted by consumers and businesses or will become rapidly obsolete. Performance of such companies may be affected by factors including obtaining and protecting patents (or the failure to do so) and significant competitive pressures, including aggressive pricing of their products or services, new market entrants, competition for market share and short product cycles due to an accelerated rate of technological developments. Such competitive pressures may lead to limited earnings and/or falling profit margins. As a result, the value of their securities may fall or fail to rise. In addition, many technology sector companies have limited operating histories and prices of these companies\\u2019 securities historically have been more volatile than other securities, especially over the short term.\\nSmall Company Securities Risk. Investments in small-capitalization companies (small-cap companies) often involve greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies (larger companies) because small-cap companies tend to have less predictable earnings and may lack the management experience, financial resources, product diversification and competitive strengths of larger companies, and securities of small-cap companies may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of larger companies.\\nValue Securities Risk. Value securities are securities of companies that may have experienced, for example, adverse business, industry or other developments or may be subject to special risks that have caused the securities to be out of favor and, in turn, potentially undervalued. The market value of a portfolio security may not meet portfolio management\\u2019s perceived value assessment of that security, or may decline in price, even though portfolio management believes the securities are already undervalued. There is also a risk that it may take longer than expected for the value of these investments to rise to portfolio management\\u2019s perceived value. In addition, value securities, at times, may not perform as well as growth securities or the stock market in general, and may be out of favor with investors for varying periods of time.\\n100\\tPROSPECTUS 2018\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS\\nSUMMARY OF COLUMBIA VP \\u2013 SELECT SMALLER-CAP VALUE FUND (continued)\\nPerformance Information\\nThe following bar chart and table show you how the Fund has performed in the past, and can help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the Fund\\u2019s Class 3 share performance has varied for each full calendar year shown. The table below the bar chart compares the Fund\\u2019s returns for the periods shown with a broad measure of market performance.\\nThe performance of one or more share classes shown in the table below begins before the indicated inception date for such share class. The returns shown for each such share class include the returns of the Fund\\u2019s Class 3 shares (adjusted to reflect the higher class-related operating expenses of such classes, where applicable) for periods prior to its inception date. Except for differences in annual returns resulting from differences in expenses (where applicable), the share classes of the Fund would have substantially similar annual returns because all share classes of the Fund invest in the same portfolio of securities.\\nThe returns shown do not reflect any fees and expenses imposed under your Contract or Qualified Plan and would be lower if they did.\\nThe Fund\\u2019s past performance is no guarantee of how the Fund will perform in the future.

If you are a Contract holder or Qualified Plan participant, please refer to your separate Contract prospectus or Qualified Plan disclosure documents for information about minimum investment requirements and how to purchase and redeem shares of the Fund on days the Fund is open for business.\\nTax Information\\nThe Fund expects to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and does not expect to make regular distributions (other than in redemption of Fund shares) to shareholders which are generally the participating insurance companies investing in the Fund through separate accounts or Qualified Plans or certain other eligible investors authorized by the Distributor. You should consult with the participating insurance company that issued your Contract, plan sponsor or other eligible investor through which your investment in the Fund is made regarding the U.S. federal income taxation of your investment.\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries\\nIf you make allocations to the Fund, the Fund, its Distributor or other related companies may pay participating insurance companies or other financial intermediaries for the allocation (sale) of Fund shares and related services in connection with such allocations to the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the participating insurance company, other financial intermediary or your salesperson to recommend an allocation to the Fund over another fund or other investment option.

Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\n$107\\t$122\\t$139\\t$189\\n \\n\\n26\\n\\n \\n\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 48% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. 10+ Year Corporate Bond Index. This Index includes U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade, fixed-rate, taxable securities issued by industrial, utility, and financial companies, with maturities greater than 10 years.\\n\\nThe Fund invests by sampling the Index, meaning that it holds a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. All of the Fund\\u2019s investments will be selected through the sampling process, and under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund\\u2019s assets will be invested in bonds included in the Index. The Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity consistent with that of the Index. As of August 31, 2018, the dollar-weighted average maturity of the Index was 23.5 years.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Interest rate risk, which is the chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the Fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.\\n\\n\\u2022 Credit risk, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer\\u2019s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be moderate for the Fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Income risk, which is the chance that the Fund\\u2019s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be low for the Fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds.\\n\\n27\\n\\n \\n\\n\\u2022 Index sampling risk, which is the chance that the securities selected for the Fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the Fund\\u2018s target index. Index sampling risk for the Fund is expected to be low.\\n\\n\\u2022 Liquidity risk, which is the chance that the Fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Fund\\u2018s Admiral Shares (including annual fund operating expenses but excluding shareholder fees) has varied from one calendar year to another over the periods shown. If applicable shareholder fees were reflected, returns would be less than those shown in the bar chart. The table shows how the average annual total returns of the Admiral Shares (including annual fund operating expenses and any applicable shareholder fees) compare with those of the Fund\\u2018s target index, which has investment characteristics similar to those of the Fund. The Fund\\u2018s Signal Shares were renamed Admiral Shares on October 16, 2013. Keep in mind that the Fund\\u2019s past performance (before and after taxes) does not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future.

It illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you were to invest $10,000 in the Fund\\u2019s shares. This example assumes that the shares provide a return of 5% each year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table. You would incur these hypothetical expenses whether or not you redeem your investment at the end of the given period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\n$8\\t$26\\t$45\\t$103\\n \\n\\n9\\n\\n \\n\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 35% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Russell 2000\\u00ae Growth Index. The Index is designed to measure the performance of small-capitalization growth stocks in the United States. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund\\u2019s target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the Fund to perform differently from the overall stock market. In addition, the Fund\\u2019s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the Fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.\\n\\n\\u2022 Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from small-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Small companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\n10\\n\\n \\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund.

The table does not reflect any fees or expenses imposed by your Contract or Qualified Plan, which are disclosed in your separate Contract prospectus or Qualified Plan disclosure documents. If the additional fees or expenses were reflected, the expenses set forth below would be higher.\\n    \\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\n \\tClass 1\\tClass 2\\tClass 3\\nManagement fees\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\nDistribution and/or service (12b-1) fees\\t0.00%\\t0.25%\\t0.13%\\nOther expenses(a)\\t0.18%\\t0.18%\\t0.18%\\nTotal annual Fund operating expenses\\t1.05%\\t1.30%\\t1.18%\\n(a)\\tOther expenses have been restated to reflect current fees paid by the Fund.\\nExample\\nThe following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over the time periods indicated, and assumes that:\\n\\u25a0\\tyou invest $10,000 in the applicable class of Fund shares for the periods indicated,\\n\\u25a0\\tyour investment has a 5% return each year, and\\n\\u25a0\\tthe Fund\\u2019s total annual operating expenses remain the same as shown in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses table above.\\nThe example does not reflect any fees and expenses that apply to your Contract or Qualified Plan. Inclusion of these charges would increase expenses for all periods shown.\\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on the assumptions listed above, your costs would be:\\n    \\n \\t1 year\\t3 years\\t5 years\\t10 years\\nClass 1 (whether or not shares are redeemed)\\t$107\\t$334\\t$579\\t$1,283\\nClass 2 (whether or not shares are redeemed)\\t$132\\t$412\\t$713\\t$1,568\\nClass 3 (whether or not shares are redeemed)\\t$120\\t$375\\t$649\\t$1,432\\nPortfolio Turnover\\nThe Fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 23% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\nUnder normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of smaller capitalization issuers. These companies have market capitalizations in the range of companies in the Russell 2000\\u00ae Value Index (the Index) at the time of purchase\\n98\\tPROSPECTUS 2018\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS\\nSUMMARY OF COLUMBIA VP \\u2013 SELECT SMALLER-CAP VALUE FUND (continued)\\n(between $4.5 million and $8.0 billion as of March 31, 2018). The market capitalization range and composition of the companies in the Index are subject to change. The Fund\\u2019s Board of Trustees may change the parameters by which smaller market capitalization is defined if it concludes such a change is appropriate.\\nThe Fund invests substantially in securities of U.S. issuers. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign investments. The Fund also invests substantially in \\u201cvalue\\u201d companies. The Fund considers \\u201cvalue\\u201d companies to be those companies believed by the investment manager to be undervalued, either historically, by the market, or as compared with issuers in the same or similar industry or sector. The Fund may from time to time emphasize one or more sectors in selecting its investments, including the financial services sector and the information technology and technology-related sectors. The Fund also may invest in real estate investment trusts. The Fund may hold a small number of securities, consistent with its value investment approach. Generally, the Fund anticipates holding between 40 and 50 securities in its portfolio; however, the Fund may hold, at any time, more or fewer securities than noted in this range.\\nPrincipal Risks\\nAn investment in the Fund involves risks, including those described below. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective and you may lose money. The value of the Fund\\u2019s holdings may decline, and the Fund\\u2019s net asset value (NAV) and share price may go down. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nActive Management Risk. Due to its active management, the Fund could underperform its benchmark index and/or other funds with similar investment objectives and/or strategies.\\nFocused Portfolio Risk. Because the Fund may invest in a limited number of companies, the Fund as a whole is subject to greater risk of loss if any of those securities decline in price.\\nForeign Securities Risk. Investments in or exposure to foreign securities involve certain risks not associated with investments in or exposure to securities of U.S. companies. Foreign securities subject the Fund to the risks associated with investing in the particular country of an issuer, including political, regulatory, economic, social, diplomatic and other conditions or events (including, for example, military confrontations, war and terrorism), occurring in the country or region, as well as risks associated with less developed custody and settlement practices. Foreign securities may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of U.S. companies, and are subject to the risks associated with potential imposition of economic and other sanctions against a particular foreign country, its nationals or industries or businesses within the country. In addition, foreign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on the Fund\\u2019s income, capital gains or proceeds from the disposition of foreign securities, which could reduce the Fund\\u2019s return on such securities. The performance of the Fund may also be negatively affected by fluctuations in a foreign currency's strength or weakness relative to the U.S. dollar, particularly to the extent the Fund invests a significant percentage of its assets in foreign securities or other assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\\nIssuer Risk. An issuer in which the Fund invests or to which it has exposure may perform poorly, and the value of its securities may therefore decline, which would negatively affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, breakthroughs in technology, reliance on suppliers, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, natural disasters or other events, conditions or factors.\\nMarket Risk. Market risk refers to the possibility that the market values of securities or other investments that the Fund holds will fall, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, or fail to rise. An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods.\\nReal Estate-Related Investment Risk. Investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and in securities of other companies (wherever organized) principally engaged in the real estate industry subject the Fund to, among other things, risks similar to those of direct investments in real estate and the real estate industry in general. These include risks related to general and local economic conditions, possible lack of availability of financing and changes in interest rates or property values. REITs are entities that either own properties or make construction or mortgage loans, and also may include operating or finance companies. The value of interests in a REIT may be affected by,\\nPROSPECTUS 2018\\t99\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS\\nSUMMARY OF COLUMBIA VP \\u2013 SELECT SMALLER-CAP VALUE FUND (continued)\\namong other factors, changes in the value of the underlying properties owned by the REIT, changes in the prospect for earnings and/or cash flow growth of the REIT itself, defaults by borrowers or tenants, market saturation, decreases in market rates for rents, and other economic, political, or regulatory matters affecting the real estate industry, including REITs. REITs and similar non-U.S. entities depend upon specialized management skills, may have limited financial resources, may have less trading volume in their securities, and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than the overall securities markets. REITs are also subject to the risk of failing to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Some REITs (especially mortgage REITs) are affected by risks similar to those associated with investments in debt securities including changes in interest rates and the quality of credit extended.\\nSector Risk. At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business in a related group of industries within a sector, including the financial services sector and the information technology and technology-related sectors. Companies in the same sector may be similarly affected by economic, regulatory, political or market events or conditions, which may make the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that sector than funds that invest more broadly. Generally, the more broadly the Fund invests, the more it spreads risk and potentially reduces the risks of loss and volatility.\\nFinancial Services Sector. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the financial services sector than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the financial services sector are subject to certain risks, including the risk of regulatory change, decreased liquidity in credit markets and unstable interest rates. Such companies may have concentrated portfolios, such as a high level of loans to real estate developers, which makes them vulnerable to economic conditions that affect that industry. Performance of such companies may be affected by competitive pressures and exposure to investments or agreements that, under certain circumstances, may lead to losses (e.g., subprime loans). Companies in the financial services sector are subject to extensive governmental regulation that may limit the amount and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make, and interest rates and fees that they may charge. In addition, profitability of such companies is largely dependent upon the availability and the cost of capital.\\nInformation Technology and Technology-Related Sectors. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the information technology sector, as well as other technology-related sectors (collectively, the technology sectors) than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the technology sectors are subject to certain risks, including the risk that new services, equipment or technologies will not be accepted by consumers and businesses or will become rapidly obsolete. Performance of such companies may be affected by factors including obtaining and protecting patents (or the failure to do so) and significant competitive pressures, including aggressive pricing of their products or services, new market entrants, competition for market share and short product cycles due to an accelerated rate of technological developments. Such competitive pressures may lead to limited earnings and/or falling profit margins. As a result, the value of their securities may fall or fail to rise. In addition, many technology sector companies have limited operating histories and prices of these companies\\u2019 securities historically have been more volatile than other securities, especially over the short term.\\nSmall Company Securities Risk. Investments in small-capitalization companies (small-cap companies) often involve greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies (larger companies) because small-cap companies tend to have less predictable earnings and may lack the management experience, financial resources, product diversification and competitive strengths of larger companies, and securities of small-cap companies may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of larger companies.\\nValue Securities Risk. Value securities are securities of companies that may have experienced, for example, adverse business, industry or other developments or may be subject to special risks that have caused the securities to be out of favor and, in turn, potentially undervalued. The market value of a portfolio security may not meet portfolio management\\u2019s perceived value assessment of that security, or may decline in price, even though portfolio management believes the securities are already undervalued. There is also a risk that it may take longer than expected for the value of these investments to rise to portfolio management\\u2019s perceived value. In addition, value securities, at times, may not perform as well as growth securities or the stock market in general, and may be out of favor with investors for varying periods of time.\\n100\\tPROSPECTUS 2018\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS\\nSUMMARY OF COLUMBIA VP \\u2013 SELECT SMALLER-CAP VALUE FUND (continued)\\nPerformance Information\\nThe following bar chart and table show you how the Fund has performed in the past, and can help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund.

(the Distributor). Shares of the Fund may not be purchased or sold by individual owners of Contracts or Qualified Plans. If you are a Contract holder or Qualified Plan participant, please refer to your separate Contract prospectus or Qualified Plan disclosure documents for information about minimum investment requirements and how to purchase and redeem shares of the Fund on days the Fund is open for business.\\nTax Information\\nThe Fund expects to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and does not expect to make regular distributions (other than in redemption of Fund shares) to shareholders which are generally the participating insurance companies investing in the Fund through separate accounts or Qualified Plans or certain other eligible investors authorized by the Distributor. You should consult with the participating insurance company that issued your Contract, plan sponsor or other eligible investor through which your investment in the Fund is made regarding the U.S. federal income taxation of your investment.\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries\\nIf you make allocations to the Fund, the Fund, its Distributor or other related companies may pay participating insurance companies or other financial intermediaries for the allocation (sale) of Fund shares and related services in connection with such allocations to the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the participating insurance company, other financial intermediary or your salesperson to recommend an allocation to the Fund over another fund or other investment option.

It illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you were to invest $10,000 in the Fund\\u2019s shares. This example assumes that the shares provide a return of 5% each year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table. You would incur these hypothetical expenses whether or not you redeem your investment at the end of the given period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\n$107\\t$122\\t$139\\t$189\\n \\n\\n26\\n\\n \\n\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 48% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. 10+ Year Corporate Bond Index. This Index includes U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade, fixed-rate, taxable securities issued by industrial, utility, and financial companies, with maturities greater than 10 years.\\n\\nThe Fund invests by sampling the Index, meaning that it holds a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. All of the Fund\\u2019s investments will be selected through the sampling process, and under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund\\u2019s assets will be invested in bonds included in the Index. The Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity consistent with that of the Index. As of August 31, 2018, the dollar-weighted average maturity of the Index was 23.5 years.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Interest rate risk, which is the chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the Fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.\\n\\n\\u2022 Credit risk, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer\\u2019s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be moderate for the Fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Income risk, which is the chance that the Fund\\u2019s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be low for the Fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds.\\n\\n27\\n\\n \\n\\n\\u2022 Index sampling risk, which is the chance that the securities selected for the Fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the Fund\\u2018s target index. Index sampling risk for the Fund is expected to be low.\\n\\n\\u2022 Liquidity risk, which is the chance that the Fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Fund\\u2018s Admiral Shares (including annual fund operating expenses but excluding shareholder fees) has varied from one calendar year to another over the periods shown. If applicable shareholder fees were reflected, returns would be less than those shown in the bar chart. The table shows how the average annual total returns of the Admiral Shares (including annual fund operating expenses and any applicable shareholder fees) compare with those of the Fund\\u2018s target index, which has investment characteristics similar to those of the Fund. The Fund\\u2018s Signal Shares were renamed Admiral Shares on October 16, 2013.

The Index is designed to measure the performance of small-capitalization growth stocks in the United States.

You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund\\u2019s target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the Fund to perform differently from the overall stock market. In addition, the Fund\\u2019s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the Fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.\\n\\n\\u2022 Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from small-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Small companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\n10\\n\\n \\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund.

The table does not reflect any fees or expenses imposed by your Contract or Qualified Plan, which are disclosed in your separate Contract prospectus or Qualified Plan disclosure documents. If the additional fees or expenses were reflected, the expenses set forth below would be higher.\\n    \\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\n \\tClass 1\\tClass 2\\tClass 3\\nManagement fees\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\nDistribution and/or service (12b-1) fees\\t0.00%\\t0.25%\\t0.13%\\nOther expenses(a)\\t0.18%\\t0.18%\\t0.18%\\nTotal annual Fund operating expenses\\t1.05%\\t1.30%\\t1.18%\\n(a)\\tOther expenses have been restated to reflect current fees paid by the Fund.\\nExample\\nThe following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over the time periods indicated, and assumes that:\\n\\u25a0\\tyou invest $10,000 in the applicable class of Fund shares for the periods indicated,\\n\\u25a0\\tyour investment has a 5% return each year, and\\n\\u25a0\\tthe Fund\\u2019s total annual operating expenses remain the same as shown in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses table above.\\nThe example does not reflect any fees and expenses that apply to your Contract or Qualified Plan. Inclusion of these charges would increase expenses for all periods shown.\\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on the assumptions listed above, your costs would be:\\n    \\n \\t1 year\\t3 years\\t5 years\\t10 years\\nClass 1 (whether or not shares are redeemed)\\t$107\\t$334\\t$579\\t$1,283\\nClass 2 (whether or not shares are redeemed)\\t$132\\t$412\\t$713\\t$1,568\\nClass 3 (whether or not shares are redeemed)\\t$120\\t$375\\t$649\\t$1,432\\nPortfolio Turnover\\nThe Fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 23% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\nUnder normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of smaller capitalization issuers. These companies have market capitalizations in the range of companies in the Russell 2000\\u00ae Value Index (the Index) at the time of purchase\\n98\\tPROSPECTUS 2018\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS\\nSUMMARY OF COLUMBIA VP \\u2013 SELECT SMALLER-CAP VALUE FUND (continued)\\n(between $4.5 million and $8.0 billion as of March 31, 2018). The market capitalization range and composition of the companies in the Index are subject to change. The Fund\\u2019s Board of Trustees may change the parameters by which smaller market capitalization is defined if it concludes such a change is appropriate.\\nThe Fund invests substantially in securities of U.S. issuers. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign investments. The Fund also invests substantially in \\u201cvalue\\u201d companies. The Fund considers \\u201cvalue\\u201d companies to be those companies believed by the investment manager to be undervalued, either historically, by the market, or as compared with issuers in the same or similar industry or sector. The Fund may from time to time emphasize one or more sectors in selecting its investments, including the financial services sector and the information technology and technology-related sectors. The Fund also may invest in real estate investment trusts. The Fund may hold a small number of securities, consistent with its value investment approach. Generally, the Fund anticipates holding between 40 and 50 securities in its portfolio; however, the Fund may hold, at any time, more or fewer securities than noted in this range.\\nPrincipal Risks\\nAn investment in the Fund involves risks, including those described below. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective and you may lose money. The value of the Fund\\u2019s holdings may decline, and the Fund\\u2019s net asset value (NAV) and share price may go down. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nActive Management Risk. Due to its active management, the Fund could underperform its benchmark index and/or other funds with similar investment objectives and/or strategies.\\nFocused Portfolio Risk. Because the Fund may invest in a limited number of companies, the Fund as a whole is subject to greater risk of loss if any of those securities decline in price.\\nForeign Securities Risk. Investments in or exposure to foreign securities involve certain risks not associated with investments in or exposure to securities of U.S. companies. Foreign securities subject the Fund to the risks associated with investing in the particular country of an issuer, including political, regulatory, economic, social, diplomatic and other conditions or events (including, for example, military confrontations, war and terrorism), occurring in the country or region, as well as risks associated with less developed custody and settlement practices. Foreign securities may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of U.S. companies, and are subject to the risks associated with potential imposition of economic and other sanctions against a particular foreign country, its nationals or industries or businesses within the country. In addition, foreign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on the Fund\\u2019s income, capital gains or proceeds from the disposition of foreign securities, which could reduce the Fund\\u2019s return on such securities. The performance of the Fund may also be negatively affected by fluctuations in a foreign currency's strength or weakness relative to the U.S. dollar, particularly to the extent the Fund invests a significant percentage of its assets in foreign securities or other assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\\nIssuer Risk. An issuer in which the Fund invests or to which it has exposure may perform poorly, and the value of its securities may therefore decline, which would negatively affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, breakthroughs in technology, reliance on suppliers, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, natural disasters or other events, conditions or factors.\\nMarket Risk. Market risk refers to the possibility that the market values of securities or other investments that the Fund holds will fall, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, or fail to rise. An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods.\\nReal Estate-Related Investment Risk. Investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and in securities of other companies (wherever organized) principally engaged in the real estate industry subject the Fund to, among other things, risks similar to those of direct investments in real estate and the real estate industry in general. These include risks related to general and local economic conditions, possible lack of availability of financing and changes in interest rates or property values. REITs are entities that either own properties or make construction or mortgage loans, and also may include operating or finance companies. The value of interests in a REIT may be affected by,\\nPROSPECTUS 2018\\t99\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS\\nSUMMARY OF COLUMBIA VP \\u2013 SELECT SMALLER-CAP VALUE FUND (continued)\\namong other factors, changes in the value of the underlying properties owned by the REIT, changes in the prospect for earnings and/or cash flow growth of the REIT itself, defaults by borrowers or tenants, market saturation, decreases in market rates for rents, and other economic, political, or regulatory matters affecting the real estate industry, including REITs. REITs and similar non-U.S. entities depend upon specialized management skills, may have limited financial resources, may have less trading volume in their securities, and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than the overall securities markets. REITs are also subject to the risk of failing to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Some REITs (especially mortgage REITs) are affected by risks similar to those associated with investments in debt securities including changes in interest rates and the quality of credit extended.\\nSector Risk. At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business in a related group of industries within a sector, including the financial services sector and the information technology and technology-related sectors. Companies in the same sector may be similarly affected by economic, regulatory, political or market events or conditions, which may make the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that sector than funds that invest more broadly. Generally, the more broadly the Fund invests, the more it spreads risk and potentially reduces the risks of loss and volatility.\\nFinancial Services Sector. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the financial services sector than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the financial services sector are subject to certain risks, including the risk of regulatory change, decreased liquidity in credit markets and unstable interest rates. Such companies may have concentrated portfolios, such as a high level of loans to real estate developers, which makes them vulnerable to economic conditions that affect that industry. Performance of such companies may be affected by competitive pressures and exposure to investments or agreements that, under certain circumstances, may lead to losses (e.g., subprime loans). Companies in the financial services sector are subject to extensive governmental regulation that may limit the amount and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make, and interest rates and fees that they may charge. In addition, profitability of such companies is largely dependent upon the availability and the cost of capital.\\nInformation Technology and Technology-Related Sectors. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the information technology sector, as well as other technology-related sectors (collectively, the technology sectors) than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the technology sectors are subject to certain risks, including the risk that new services, equipment or technologies will not be accepted by consumers and businesses or will become rapidly obsolete. Performance of such companies may be affected by factors including obtaining and protecting patents (or the failure to do so) and significant competitive pressures, including aggressive pricing of their products or services, new market entrants, competition for market share and short product cycles due to an accelerated rate of technological developments. Such competitive pressures may lead to limited earnings and/or falling profit margins. As a result, the value of their securities may fall or fail to rise. In addition, many technology sector companies have limited operating histories and prices of these companies\\u2019 securities historically have been more volatile than other securities, especially over the short term.\\nSmall Company Securities Risk. Investments in small-capitalization companies (small-cap companies) often involve greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies (larger companies) because small-cap companies tend to have less predictable earnings and may lack the management experience, financial resources, product diversification and competitive strengths of larger companies, and securities of small-cap companies may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of larger companies.\\nValue Securities Risk. Value securities are securities of companies that may have experienced, for example, adverse business, industry or other developments or may be subject to special risks that have caused the securities to be out of favor and, in turn, potentially undervalued. The market value of a portfolio security may not meet portfolio management\\u2019s perceived value assessment of that security, or may decline in price, even though portfolio management believes the securities are already undervalued. There is also a risk that it may take longer than expected for the value of these investments to rise to portfolio management\\u2019s perceived value. In addition, value securities, at times, may not perform as well as growth securities or the stock market in general, and may be out of favor with investors for varying periods of time.\\n100\\tPROSPECTUS 2018\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS\\nSUMMARY OF COLUMBIA VP \\u2013 SELECT SMALLER-CAP VALUE FUND (continued)\\nPerformance Information\\nThe following bar chart and table show you how the Fund has performed in the past, and can help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the Fund\\u2019s Class 3 share performance has varied for each full calendar year shown. The table below the bar chart compares the Fund\\u2019s returns for the periods shown with a broad measure of market performance.\\nThe performance of one or more share classes shown in the table below begins before the indicated inception date for such share class. The returns shown for each such share class include the returns of the Fund\\u2019s Class 3 shares (adjusted to reflect the higher class-related operating expenses of such classes, where applicable) for periods prior to its inception date. Except for differences in annual returns resulting from differences in expenses (where applicable), the share classes of the Fund would have substantially similar annual returns because all share classes of the Fund invest in the same portfolio of securities.\\nThe returns shown do not reflect any fees and expenses imposed under your Contract or Qualified Plan and would be lower if they did.\\nThe Fund\\u2019s past performance is no guarantee of how the Fund will perform in the future.

(the Distributor). Shares of the Fund may not be purchased or sold by individual owners of Contracts or Qualified Plans. If you are a Contract holder or Qualified Plan participant, please refer to your separate Contract prospectus or Qualified Plan disclosure documents for information about minimum investment requirements and how to purchase and redeem shares of the Fund on days the Fund is open for business.\\nTax Information\\nThe Fund expects to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and does not expect to make regular distributions (other than in redemption of Fund shares) to shareholders which are generally the participating insurance companies investing in the Fund through separate accounts or Qualified Plans or certain other eligible investors authorized by the Distributor. You should consult with the participating insurance company that issued your Contract, plan sponsor or other eligible investor through which your investment in the Fund is made regarding the U.S. federal income taxation of your investment.\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries\\nIf you make allocations to the Fund, the Fund, its Distributor or other related companies may pay participating insurance companies or other financial intermediaries for the allocation (sale) of Fund shares and related services in connection with such allocations to the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the participating insurance company, other financial intermediary or your salesperson to recommend an allocation to the Fund over another fund or other investment option. Ask your financial advisor or salesperson or visit your financial intermediary\\u2019s website for more information.\",\n          \"Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond Index Fund\\n\\nInvestment Objective\\n\\nThe Fund seeks to track the performance of a market-weighted corporate bond index with a long-term dollar-weighted average maturity.\\n\\nFees and Expenses\\n\\nThe following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold Admiral Shares of the Fund.\\n\\nShareholder Fees\\t \\n(Fees paid directly from your investment)\\t \\n \\nSales Charge (Load) Imposed on Purchases\\tNone\\nPurchase Fee\\t1%\\nSales Charge (Load) Imposed on Reinvested Dividends\\tNone\\nRedemption Fee\\tNone\\nAccount Service Fee (for certain fund account balances below $10,000)\\t$20/year\\n \\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses\\t \\n(Expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\t \\n \\nManagement Fees\\t0.06%\\n12b-1 Distribution Fee\\tNone\\nOther Expenses\\t0.01%\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\t0.07%\\n \\n\\nExample\\n\\nThe following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund\\u2019s Admiral Shares with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. It illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you were to invest $10,000 in the Fund\\u2019s shares. This example assumes that the shares provide a return of 5% each year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table. You would incur these hypothetical expenses whether or not you redeem your investment at the end of the given period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\n$107\\t$122\\t$139\\t$189\\n \\n\\n26\\n\\n \\n\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 48% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. 10+ Year Corporate Bond Index. This Index includes U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade, fixed-rate, taxable securities issued by industrial, utility, and financial companies, with maturities greater than 10 years.\\n\\nThe Fund invests by sampling the Index, meaning that it holds a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. All of the Fund\\u2019s investments will be selected through the sampling process, and under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund\\u2019s assets will be invested in bonds included in the Index. The Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity consistent with that of the Index. As of August 31, 2018, the dollar-weighted average maturity of the Index was 23.5 years.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Interest rate risk, which is the chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the Fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.\\n\\n\\u2022 Credit risk, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer\\u2019s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be moderate for the Fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Income risk, which is the chance that the Fund\\u2019s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be low for the Fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds.\\n\\n27\\n\\n \\n\\n\\u2022 Index sampling risk, which is the chance that the securities selected for the Fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the Fund\\u2018s target index. Index sampling risk for the Fund is expected to be low.\\n\\n\\u2022 Liquidity risk, which is the chance that the Fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Fund\\u2018s Admiral Shares (including annual fund operating expenses but excluding shareholder fees) has varied from one calendar year to another over the periods shown. If applicable shareholder fees were reflected, returns would be less than those shown in the bar chart. The table shows how the average annual total returns of the Admiral Shares (including annual fund operating expenses and any applicable shareholder fees) compare with those of the Fund\\u2018s target index, which has investment characteristics similar to those of the Fund. The Fund\\u2018s Signal Shares were renamed Admiral Shares on October 16, 2013.

These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 35% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Russell 2000\\u00ae Growth Index. The Index is designed to measure the performance of small-capitalization growth stocks in the United States. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund\\u2019s target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the Fund to perform differently from the overall stock market. In addition, the Fund\\u2019s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the Fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.\\n\\n\\u2022 Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from small-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Small companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\n10\\n\\n \\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 23% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\nUnder normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of smaller capitalization issuers. These companies have market capitalizations in the range of companies in the Russell 2000\\u00ae Value Index (the Index) at the time of purchase\\n98\\tPROSPECTUS 2018\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS\\nSUMMARY OF COLUMBIA VP \\u2013 SELECT SMALLER-CAP VALUE FUND (continued)\\n(between $4.5 million and $8.0 billion as of March 31, 2018). The market capitalization range and composition of the companies in the Index are subject to change. The Fund\\u2019s Board of Trustees may change the parameters by which smaller market capitalization is defined if it concludes such a change is appropriate.\\nThe Fund invests substantially in securities of U.S. issuers. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign investments. The Fund also invests substantially in \\u201cvalue\\u201d companies. The Fund considers \\u201cvalue\\u201d companies to be those companies believed by the investment manager to be undervalued, either historically, by the market, or as compared with issuers in the same or similar industry or sector. The Fund may from time to time emphasize one or more sectors in selecting its investments, including the financial services sector and the information technology and technology-related sectors. The Fund also may invest in real estate investment trusts. The Fund may hold a small number of securities, consistent with its value investment approach. Generally, the Fund anticipates holding between 40 and 50 securities in its portfolio; however, the Fund may hold, at any time, more or fewer securities than noted in this range.\\nPrincipal Risks\\nAn investment in the Fund involves risks, including those described below. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective and you may lose money. The value of the Fund\\u2019s holdings may decline, and the Fund\\u2019s net asset value (NAV) and share price may go down. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nActive Management Risk. Due to its active management, the Fund could underperform its benchmark index and/or other funds with similar investment objectives and/or strategies.\\nFocused Portfolio Risk. Because the Fund may invest in a limited number of companies, the Fund as a whole is subject to greater risk of loss if any of those securities decline in price.\\nForeign Securities Risk. Investments in or exposure to foreign securities involve certain risks not associated with investments in or exposure to securities of U.S. companies. Foreign securities subject the Fund to the risks associated with investing in the particular country of an issuer, including political, regulatory, economic, social, diplomatic and other conditions or events (including, for example, military confrontations, war and terrorism), occurring in the country or region, as well as risks associated with less developed custody and settlement practices. Foreign securities may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of U.S. companies, and are subject to the risks associated with potential imposition of economic and other sanctions against a particular foreign country, its nationals or industries or businesses within the country. In addition, foreign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on the Fund\\u2019s income, capital gains or proceeds from the disposition of foreign securities, which could reduce the Fund\\u2019s return on such securities. The performance of the Fund may also be negatively affected by fluctuations in a foreign currency's strength or weakness relative to the U.S. dollar, particularly to the extent the Fund invests a significant percentage of its assets in foreign securities or other assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\\nIssuer Risk. An issuer in which the Fund invests or to which it has exposure may perform poorly, and the value of its securities may therefore decline, which would negatively affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, breakthroughs in technology, reliance on suppliers, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, natural disasters or other events, conditions or factors.\\nMarket Risk. Market risk refers to the possibility that the market values of securities or other investments that the Fund holds will fall, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, or fail to rise. An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods.\\nReal Estate-Related Investment Risk. Investments in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and in securities of other companies (wherever organized) principally engaged in the real estate industry subject the Fund to, among other things, risks similar to those of direct investments in real estate and the real estate industry in general. These include risks related to general and local economic conditions, possible lack of availability of financing and changes in interest rates or property values. REITs are entities that either own properties or make construction or mortgage loans, and also may include operating or finance companies. The value of interests in a REIT may be affected by,\\nPROSPECTUS 2018\\t99\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS\\nSUMMARY OF COLUMBIA VP \\u2013 SELECT SMALLER-CAP VALUE FUND (continued)\\namong other factors, changes in the value of the underlying properties owned by the REIT, changes in the prospect for earnings and/or cash flow growth of the REIT itself, defaults by borrowers or tenants, market saturation, decreases in market rates for rents, and other economic, political, or regulatory matters affecting the real estate industry, including REITs. REITs and similar non-U.S. entities depend upon specialized management skills, may have limited financial resources, may have less trading volume in their securities, and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than the overall securities markets. REITs are also subject to the risk of failing to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Some REITs (especially mortgage REITs) are affected by risks similar to those associated with investments in debt securities including changes in interest rates and the quality of credit extended.\\nSector Risk. At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business in a related group of industries within a sector, including the financial services sector and the information technology and technology-related sectors. Companies in the same sector may be similarly affected by economic, regulatory, political or market events or conditions, which may make the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that sector than funds that invest more broadly. Generally, the more broadly the Fund invests, the more it spreads risk and potentially reduces the risks of loss and volatility.\\nFinancial Services Sector. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the financial services sector than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the financial services sector are subject to certain risks, including the risk of regulatory change, decreased liquidity in credit markets and unstable interest rates. Such companies may have concentrated portfolios, such as a high level of loans to real estate developers, which makes them vulnerable to economic conditions that affect that industry. Performance of such companies may be affected by competitive pressures and exposure to investments or agreements that, under certain circumstances, may lead to losses (e.g., subprime loans). Companies in the financial services sector are subject to extensive governmental regulation that may limit the amount and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make, and interest rates and fees that they may charge. In addition, profitability of such companies is largely dependent upon the availability and the cost of capital.\\nInformation Technology and Technology-Related Sectors. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the information technology sector, as well as other technology-related sectors (collectively, the technology sectors) than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the technology sectors are subject to certain risks, including the risk that new services, equipment or technologies will not be accepted by consumers and businesses or will become rapidly obsolete. Performance of such companies may be affected by factors including obtaining and protecting patents (or the failure to do so) and significant competitive pressures, including aggressive pricing of their products or services, new market entrants, competition for market share and short product cycles due to an accelerated rate of technological developments. Such competitive pressures may lead to limited earnings and/or falling profit margins. As a result, the value of their securities may fall or fail to rise. In addition, many technology sector companies have limited operating histories and prices of these companies\\u2019 securities historically have been more volatile than other securities, especially over the short term.\\nSmall Company Securities Risk. Investments in small-capitalization companies (small-cap companies) often involve greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies (larger companies) because small-cap companies tend to have less predictable earnings and may lack the management experience, financial resources, product diversification and competitive strengths of larger companies, and securities of small-cap companies may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of larger companies.\\nValue Securities Risk. Value securities are securities of companies that may have experienced, for example, adverse business, industry or other developments or may be subject to special risks that have caused the securities to be out of favor and, in turn, potentially undervalued. The market value of a portfolio security may not meet portfolio management\\u2019s perceived value assessment of that security, or may decline in price, even though portfolio management believes the securities are already undervalued. There is also a risk that it may take longer than expected for the value of these investments to rise to portfolio management\\u2019s perceived value. In addition, value securities, at times, may not perform as well as growth securities or the stock market in general, and may be out of favor with investors for varying periods of time.\\n100\\tPROSPECTUS 2018\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA VARIABLE PORTFOLIO FUNDS\\nSUMMARY OF COLUMBIA VP \\u2013 SELECT SMALLER-CAP VALUE FUND (continued)\\nPerformance Information\\nThe following bar chart and table show you how the Fund has performed in the past, and can help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund.

(the Distributor). Shares of the Fund may not be purchased or sold by individual owners of Contracts or Qualified Plans. If you are a Contract holder or Qualified Plan participant, please refer to your separate Contract prospectus or Qualified Plan disclosure documents for information about minimum investment requirements and how to purchase and redeem shares of the Fund on days the Fund is open for business.\\nTax Information\\nThe Fund expects to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and does not expect to make regular distributions (other than in redemption of Fund shares) to shareholders which are generally the participating insurance companies investing in the Fund through separate accounts or Qualified Plans or certain other eligible investors authorized by the Distributor. You should consult with the participating insurance company that issued your Contract, plan sponsor or other eligible investor through which your investment in the Fund is made regarding the U.S. federal income taxation of your investment.\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries\\nIf you make allocations to the Fund, the Fund, its Distributor or other related companies may pay participating insurance companies or other financial intermediaries for the allocation (sale) of Fund shares and related services in connection with such allocations to the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the participating insurance company, other financial intermediary or your salesperson to recommend an allocation to the Fund over another fund or other investment option.

It illustrates the hypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you were to invest $10,000 in the Fund\\u2019s shares. This example assumes that the shares provide a return of 5% each year and that total annual fund operating expenses remain as stated in the preceding table. You would incur these hypothetical expenses whether or not you redeem your investment at the end of the given period. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\n$107\\t$122\\t$139\\t$189\\n \\n\\n26\\n\\n \\n\\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 48% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. 10+ Year Corporate Bond Index. This Index includes U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade, fixed-rate, taxable securities issued by industrial, utility, and financial companies, with maturities greater than 10 years.\\n\\nThe Fund invests by sampling the Index, meaning that it holds a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. All of the Fund\\u2019s investments will be selected through the sampling process, and under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund\\u2019s assets will be invested in bonds included in the Index. The Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity consistent with that of the Index. As of August 31, 2018, the dollar-weighted average maturity of the Index was 23.5 years.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Interest rate risk, which is the chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the Fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.\\n\\n\\u2022 Credit risk, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer\\u2019s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be moderate for the Fund.\\n\\n\\u2022 Income risk, which is the chance that the Fund\\u2019s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be low for the Fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds.\\n\\n27\\n\\n \\n\\n\\u2022 Index sampling risk, which is the chance that the securities selected for the Fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the Fund\\u2018s target index. Index sampling risk for the Fund is expected to be low.\\n\\n\\u2022 Liquidity risk, which is the chance that the Fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Fund\\u2018s Admiral Shares (including annual fund operating expenses but excluding shareholder fees) has varied from one calendar year to another over the periods shown. If applicable shareholder fees were reflected, returns would be less than those shown in the bar chart. The table shows how the average annual total returns of the Admiral Shares (including annual fund operating expenses and any applicable shareholder fees) compare with those of the Fund\\u2018s target index, which has investment characteristics similar to those of the Fund.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 35% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Russell 2000\\u00ae Growth Index. The Index is designed to measure the performance of small-capitalization growth stocks in the United States. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the Fund\\u2019s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the Fund\\u2019s performance:\\n\\n\\u2022 Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The Fund\\u2019s target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the Fund to perform differently from the overall stock market. In addition, the Fund\\u2019s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the Fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.\\n\\n\\u2022 Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from small-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Small companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.\\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\n\\n10\\n\\n \\n\\nAnnual Total Returns\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund.
