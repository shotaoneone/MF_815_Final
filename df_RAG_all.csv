Principal Investment Strategies

The fund invests in California municipal and other debt securities with an emphasis on high-yield securities.

Cities, counties and other municipalities in California and U.S. territories usually issue these securities for public projects, such as schools, roads, and water and sewer systems.

The basic investment philosophy of the investment adviser is to seek to invest in attractively priced securities that, in its opinion, represent good, long-term investment opportunities. The investment adviser believes that an important way to accomplish this is through fundamental research, which may include analysis of credit quality, general economic conditions and various quantitative measures and, in the case of corporate obligations, meeting with company executives and employees, suppliers, customers and competitors. Securities may be sold when the investment adviser believes that they no longer represent relatively attractive investment opportunities.

Principal Investment Strategies

The fund’s asset allocation strategy seeks to diversify its investments among equity securities, debt securities, U.S. Treasury inflation-indexed securities, commodity-related investments and real estate-related investments, all in an effort to provide investors total real return. Total real return is total return reduced by the expected impact of inflation. The fund’s investment strategy has been designed in an effort to protect the fund’s investors from the effects of rising U.S. inflation. The portfolio managers will regularly review the fund’s asset mix and adjust the allocation among asset classes as necessary to provide the fund what they believe is the most favorable outlook for achieving the fund’s objective. By adjusting the allocation among asset classes the portfolio managers can moderate risks associated with each asset category.",{'source': 'MutualFundSummary/MULTI-ASSET REAL RETURN FUND.txt'}

Principal Risks

Small Cap Stocks – The smaller companies in which the fund invests may be more volatile and subject to greater risk than larger companies. Smaller companies may have limited financial resources, product lines and markets, and their securities may trade less frequently and in more limited volumes than the securities of larger companies, which could lead to higher transaction costs.

Style Risk – If at any time the market is not favoring the fund’s quantitative investment style, the fund’s gains may not be as big as, or its losses may be bigger than, those of other equity funds using different investment styles.",{'source': 'MutualFundSummary/NT SMALL COMPANY.txt'}

Principal Investment Strategies

The fund will generally invest in larger-sized companies using a quantitative model that combines fundamental measures of a stock’s value and growth potential. To measure value, the managers may use ratios of stock price-to-earnings and stock price-to-cash flow, among others. To measure growth, the managers may use the rate of growth of a company’s earnings and cash flow and changes in its earnings estimates, as well as other factors. The model also considers price momentum. The portfolio managers also take environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") factors into account in making investment decisions.  The portfolio managers attempt to build a portfolio of stocks that provides better returns than, and a dividend yield comparable to, the S&P 500® Index, without taking on significant additional risk.

Under normal market conditions, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities.",{'source': 'MutualFundSummary/SUSTAINABLE EQUITY FUND.txt'}
