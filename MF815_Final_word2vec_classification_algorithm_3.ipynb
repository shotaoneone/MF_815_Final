              "'Fund Summary\\nInvestment Objective\\nThe fund seeks long-term capital growth.\\nFees and Expenses\\nThe following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in American Century Investments funds. More information about these and other discounts is available from your financial professional and in Calculation of Sales Charges on page 12 of the fund’s prospectus, Appendix A of the fund’s prospectus and Sales Charges in Appendix B of the statement of additional information.\\nShareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment)\\n \\n \\nInvestor\\nI1\\nA\\nC\\nR\\nMaximum Sales Charge (Load) Imposed on\\nPurchases (as a percentage of offering price)\\nNone\\nNone\\n5.75%\\nNone\\nNone\\nMaximum Deferred Sales Charge (Load)\\n(as a percentage of the lower of the original\\noffering price or redemption proceeds when redeemed\\nwithin one year of purchase)\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone²\\n1.00%\\nNone\\nMaximum Annual Account Maintenance Fee\\n(waived for unmatured Giftrust accounts or if\\neligible investments total at least $10,000)\\n$25\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\n \\nInvestor\\nI\\nA\\nC\\nR\\nManagement Fee\\n1.00%\\n0.80%\\n1.00%\\n1.00%\\n1.00%\\nDistribution and Service (12b-1) Fees\\nNone\\nNone\\n0.25%\\n1.00%\\n0.50%\\nOther Expenses\\n0.01%\\n0.01%\\n0.01%\\n0.01%\\n0.01%\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\n1.01%\\n0.81%\\n1.26%\\n2.01%\\n1.51%\\n1 \\nPrior to April 10, 2017, this class was referred to as the Institutional Class.\\n2 \\nPurchases of $1 million or more may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge of 1.00% if the shares are redeemed within one year of the date of the purchase.\\nExample\\nThe example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods, that you earn a 5% return each year, and that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same. You may be required to pay brokerage commissions on your purchases of Investor or I Class shares of the fund, which are not reflected in the example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n \\n1 year\\n3 years\\n5 years\\n10 years\\nInvestor Class\\n$103\\n$322\\n$559\\n$1,236\\nI Class\\n$83\\n$259\\n$450\\n$1,002\\nA Class\\n$696\\n$952\\n$1,228\\n$2,010\\nC Class\\n$204\\n$632\\n$1,084\\n$2,334\\nR Class\\n$154\\n$478\\n$824\\n$1,800\\nPortfolio Turnover\\nThe fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 44% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\n2#\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies \\nThe portfolio managers look for stocks of companies of all sizes they believe will increase in value over time, using an investment strategy developed by the fund’s investment advisor. In implementing this strategy, the portfolio managers make their investment decisions based primarily on their analysis of individual companies, rather than on broad economic forecasts. The portfolio managers use a variety of analytical research tools and techniques to identify companies that meet their investment criteria. Under normal market conditions, the fund’s portfolio will primarily consist of securities of companies demonstrating business improvement. Analytical indicators helping to identify signs of business improvement could include accelerating earnings or revenue growth rates, increasing cash flows, or other indications of the relative strength of a company’s business. These techniques help the portfolio managers buy or hold the stocks of companies they believe have favorable growth prospects and sell the stocks of companies whose characteristics no longer meet their criteria.\\nAlthough the portfolio managers intend to invest the fund’s assets primarily in U.S. securities, the fund may invest in securities of foreign companies when these securities meet the portfolio managers’ standards of selection.\\nThe fund may write covered calls on a portion of the fund’s holdings in common stock when the portfolio managers believe call premiums are attractive relative to the price of the underlying security.\\nPrincipal Risks \\n•\\nGrowth Stocks — Investments in growth stocks may be more volatile than other stocks and the overall stock market. These stocks are typically priced higher than other stocks because of their growth potential, which may or may not be realized.\\n•\\nSmall and Mid Cap Stocks — The fund invests in mid-sized and smaller companies, which may be more volatile and subject to greater risk than larger companies. Smaller companies may have limited financial resources, product lines and markets, and their securities may trade less frequently and in more limited volumes than the securities of larger companies, which could lead to higher transaction costs.\\n•\\nStyle Risk — If at any time the market is not favoring the fund’s growth investment style, the fund’s gains may not be as big as, or its losses may be bigger than, those of other equity funds using different investment styles.\\n•\\nForeign Securities — The fund may invest in foreign securities, which can be riskier than investing in U.S. securities. Securities of foreign issuers may be less liquid, more volatile and harder to value than U.S. securities.\\n•\\nCovered Call Risk  — Writing covered calls may limit the fund’s ability to participate in price increases of the underlying securities and could lower the fund’s return.\\n•\\nPrice Volatility — The value of the fund’s shares may fluctuate significantly in the short term.\\n•\\nMarket Risk — The value of the fund’s shares will go up and down based on the performance of the companies whose securities it owns and other factors generally affecting the securities market.\\n•\\nPrincipal Loss – At any given time your shares may be worth less than the price you paid for them. In other words, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a bank deposit, and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.\\nFund Performance \\nThe following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The bar chart shows changes in the fund’s performance from year to year for Investor Class shares. The table shows how the fund’s average annual returns for the periods shown compared with those of a broad measure of market performance. The fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the fund will perform in the future. For current performance information, please visit americancentury.com. \\nSales charges and account fees, if applicable, are not reflected in the bar chart. If those charges were included, returns would be less than those shown.\\n\\n3#\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalendar Year Total Returns \\nchart-4e88d1b1ec1288e862aa01.jpg\\nHighest Performance Quarter (1Q 2012): 18.71% Lowest Performance Quarter (4Q 2008): -26.56%\\nAverage Annual Total Returns \\nFor the calendar year ended December 31, 2017\\n1 year\\n5 years\\n10 years\\nSince Inception\\nInception Date\\nInvestor Class Return Before Taxes\\n24.87%\\n14.13%\\n6.76%\\n—\\n11/25/1983\\nReturn After Taxes on Distributions\\n22.57%\\n11.48%\\n5.36%\\n—\\n11/25/1983\\nReturn After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund  Shares\\n15.98%\\n10.85%\\n5.22%\\n—\\n11/25/1983\\nI Class Return Before Taxes\\n25.14%\\n14.36%\\n—\\n15.32%\\n09/30/2011\\nA Class1 Return Before Taxes\\n17.42%\\n12.51%\\n5.87%\\n—\\n09/30/2011\\nC Class1 Return Before Taxes\\n23.63%\\n12.99%\\n5.70%\\n—\\n09/30/2011\\nR Class1 Return Before Taxes\\n24.24%\\n13.57%\\n6.23%\\n—\\n09/30/2011\\nRussell 3000® Growth Index\\n   (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes)\\n29.59%\\n17.15%\\n9.93%\\n—\\n—   \\n \\n1 \\nHistorical performance for A, C and R Classes prior to their inception is based on the performance of Investor Class shares. A, C and R Class performance has been adjusted to reflect differences in sales charges, if applicable, and expenses between classes.\\nThe after-tax returns are shown only for Investor Class shares. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or IRAs.\\nPortfolio Management \\nInvestment Advisor \\nAmerican Century Investment Management, Inc. \\nPortfolio Managers \\nGregory J. Woodhams , CFA, Co-CIO, Global Growth Equity, Senior Vice President and Senior Portfolio Manager, has been a member of the team that manages the fund since 2018.\\nJoseph Reiland , CFA, Vice President and Portfolio Manager, has been a member of the team that manages the fund since 2018.\\n\\n4#\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares  \\nYou may purchase or redeem shares of the fund on any business day through our website at americancentury.com, in person (at one of our Investor Centers), by mail (American Century Investments, P.O. Box 419200, Kansas City, MO 64141-6200), by telephone at 1-800-345-2021 (Investor Services Representative) or 1-800-345-3533 (Business, Not-For-Profit and Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plans), or through a financial intermediary. Shares may be purchased and redemption proceeds received by electronic bank transfer, by check or by wire. \\nUnless otherwise specified below, the minimum initial investment amount to open an account is $2,500 ($2,000 for Coverdell Education Savings Accounts). Investors opening accounts through financial intermediaries may open an account with $250 for Investor, A, C and R Classes, but the financial intermediaries may require their clients to meet different investment minimums. The minimum may be waived for broker-dealer sponsored wrap program accounts, fee based accounts, and accounts through bank/trust and wealth management advisory organizations. \\nThe minimum initial investment amount for I Class is generally $5 million ($3 million for endowments and foundations), but the minimum may be waived if you have an aggregate investment in the American Century family of funds of $10 million or more ($5 million for endowments and foundations). This includes accounts held directly with American Century and those held through a financial intermediary. \\nFor Investor, A, C and R Classes, there is no minimum initial investment amount for certain employer-sponsored retirement plans, however, financial intermediaries or plan recordkeepers may require plans to meet different minimums. For purposes of fund minimums, employer-sponsored retirement plans do not include SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs or SARSEPs.  Employer-sponsored retirement plans are not eligible to invest in the I Class.\\nThere is a $50 minimum for subsequent purchases, except there is no subsequent purchase minimum for financial intermediaries or employer-sponsored retirement plans. \\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares Through a Giftrust®  \\nPrior to June 21, 2017, All Cap Growth shares could be purchased to establish a Giftrust, which was a product created by American Century as a way to invest in the fund for someone other than yourself through a one-time gift held in an irrevocable trust.\\nAs of June 21, 2017, no new Giftrusts may be opened. However, additional shares may be purchased for Giftrusts established prior to August 1, 2002, by check or by wire.\\nOnce a Giftrust matures, the shares are transferred out of the Giftrust and into a new account registered in the beneficiary’s individual name. The beneficiary may purchase additional shares or redeem shares in the new account as indicated above in the Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares section.\\nTax Information \\nFund distributions are generally taxable as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred account such as a 401(k) or individual retirement account (in which case you may be taxed upon withdrawal of your investment from such account).  \\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries \\nIf you purchase the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank, insurance company, plan sponsor or financial professional), the fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.'"

The front-end sales charge applicable to Class T shares is a per-transaction charge, meaning that separate orders will not be aggregated for purposes of calculating the rate of the sales charge payable. An investor transacting in a class of Fund shares without any front-end sales charge, contingent deferred sales charge, or other asset-based fee for sales or distribution may be required to pay a commission to the financial intermediary for effecting such transactions. Such commission rates are set by the financial intermediary and are not reflected in the tables or the example below. You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and members of your immediate family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in certain classes of shares of eligible funds distributed by Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. (the Distributor). More information is available about these and other sales charge discounts and waivers from your financial intermediary, and can be found in the Choosing a Share Class section beginning on page 21 of the Fund\\u2019s prospectus, in Appendix A to the prospectus beginning on page A-1 and in Appendix S to the Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under Sales Charge Waivers beginning on page S-1.\\n    \\nShareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment)\\n \\tClass A\\tClass C\\tClass T\\tClasses Adv,\\nInst, Inst2,\\nInst3 and R\\nMaximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a % of offering price)\\t5.75%\\tNone\\t2.50%\\tNone\\nMaximum deferred sales charge (load) imposed on redemptions (as a % of the lower of the original purchase price or current net asset value)\\t1.00% (a)\\t1.00% (b)\\tNone\\tNone\\n    \\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\n \\tClass A\\tClass Adv\\tClass C\\tClass Inst\\tClass Inst2\\tClass Inst3\\tClass R\\tClass T\\nManagement fees\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\nDistribution and/or service (12b-1) fees\\t0.25%\\t0.00%\\t1.00%\\t0.00%\\t0.00%\\t0.00%\\t0.50%\\t0.25%\\nOther expenses(c)\\t0.11%\\t0.11%\\t0.11%\\t0.11%\\t0.07%\\t0.02%\\t0.11%\\t0.11%\\nTotal annual Fund operating expenses\\t1.23%\\t0.98%\\t1.98%\\t0.98%\\t0.94%\\t0.89%\\t1.48%\\t1.23%\\n(a)\\tThis charge is imposed on certain investments of between $1 million and $50 million redeemed within 18 months after purchase, as follows: 1.00% if redeemed within 12 months after purchase, and 0.50% if redeemed more than 12, but less than 18, months after purchase, with certain limited exceptions.\\n(b)\\tThis charge applies to redemptions within 12 months after purchase, with certain limited exceptions.\\n(c)\\tOther expenses have been restated to reflect current transfer agency fees paid by the Fund.\\nExample\\nThe following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 39% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of companies operating in the communications, information and related industries. Accordingly, the Fund invests in companies operating in the information technology and telecommunications sectors as well as those in the media industry. In addition, as noted above, the Fund may invest in related industries, which provides the Fund with broad investment flexibility to invest in any industry and many of the issuers in which the Fund invests are technology and technology-related companies. These technology and technology-related companies may include companies operating in any industry, including but not limited to software, hardware, health care, medical technology and technology services, such as the internet.\\nThe Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign investments.\\nThe Fund may invest in securities of large capitalization companies that are well established and can be expected to grow with the market. The Fund may also invest in small-to-medium size capitalization companies that the Fund\\u2019s portfolio managers believe provide opportunities to benefit from the rapidly changing technologies and the expansion of the communications, information and related industries. These securities generally include common stocks.\\nThe Fund is non-diversified, which means that it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of fewer issuers than can a diversified fund.\\nPrincipal Risks\\nAn investment in the Fund involves risks, including those described below. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective and you may lose money. The value of the Fund\\u2019s holdings may decline, and the Fund\\u2019s net asset value (NAV) and share price may go down. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nActive Management Risk. Due to its active management, the Fund could underperform its benchmark index and/or other funds with similar investment objectives and/or strategies.\\nForeign Securities Risk. Investments in or exposure to foreign securities involve certain risks not associated with investments in or exposure to securities of U.S. companies. Foreign securities subject the Fund to the risks associated with investing in the particular country of an issuer, including political, regulatory, economic, social, diplomatic and other conditions or events (including, for example, military confrontations, war and terrorism),\\n4\\tPROSPECTUS 2018\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA SELIGMAN COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION FUND\\nSUMMARY OF THE FUND (continued)\\noccurring in the country or region, as well as risks associated with less developed custody and settlement practices. Foreign securities may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of U.S. companies, and are subject to the risks associated with potential imposition of economic and other sanctions against a particular foreign country, its nationals or industries or businesses within the country. In addition, foreign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on the Fund\\u2019s income, capital gains or proceeds from the disposition of foreign securities, which could reduce the Fund\\u2019s return on such securities. The performance of the Fund may also be negatively affected by fluctuations in a foreign currency's strength or weakness relative to the U.S. dollar, particularly to the extent the Fund invests a significant percentage of its assets in foreign securities or other assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\\nGrowth Securities Risk. Growth securities typically trade at a higher multiple of earnings than other types of equity securities. Accordingly, the market values of growth securities may never reach their expected market value and may decline in price. In addition, growth securities, at times, may not perform as well as value securities or the stock market in general, and may be out of favor with investors for varying periods of time.\\nIssuer Risk. An issuer in which the Fund invests or to which it has exposure may perform poorly, and the value of its securities may therefore decline, which would negatively affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, breakthroughs in technology, reliance on suppliers, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, natural disasters or other events, conditions or factors. The market capitalization of an issuer may also impact its risk profile. Investments in larger, more established companies may involve certain risks associated with their larger size. For instance, larger, more established companies may be less able to respond quickly to new competitive challenges, such as changes in consumer tastes or innovation from smaller competitors. Also, larger companies are sometimes less able to attain the high growth rates of successful smaller companies, especially during extended periods of economic expansion.\\nLiquidity Risk. Liquidity risk is the risk associated with any event, circumstance, or characteristic of an investment or market that negatively impacts the Fund\\u2019s ability to sell, or realize the proceeds from the sale of, an investment at a desirable time or price. Liquidity risk may arise because of, for example, a lack of marketability of the investment, which means that when seeking to sell its portfolio investments, the Fund could find that selling is more difficult than anticipated, especially during times of high market volatility. Market participants attempting to sell the same or a similar instrument at the same time as the Fund could exacerbate the Fund\\u2019s exposure to liquidity risk. The Fund may have to accept a lower selling price for the holding, sell other liquid or more liquid investments that it might otherwise prefer to hold (thereby increasing the proportion of the Fund\\u2019s investments in less liquid or illiquid securities), or forego another more appealing investment opportunity. Certain investments that were liquid when purchased by the Fund may later become illiquid, particularly in times of overall economic distress. Changing regulatory, market or other conditions or environments (for example, the interest rate or credit environments) may also adversely affect the liquidity and the price of the Fund's investments. Judgment plays a larger role in valuing illiquid or less liquid investments as compared to valuing liquid or more liquid investments. Price volatility may be higher for illiquid or less liquid investments as a result of, for example, the relatively less frequent pricing of such securities (as compared to liquid or more liquid investments). Generally, the less liquid the market at the time the Fund sells a portfolio investment, the greater the risk of loss or decline of value to the Fund. Overall market liquidity and other factors can lead to an increase in redemptions, which may negatively impact Fund performance and NAV, including, for example, if the Fund is forced to sell investments in a down market. Foreign securities can present enhanced liquidity risks, including as a result of less developed custody, settlement or other practices of foreign markets.\\nMarket Risk. Market risk refers to the possibility that the market values of securities or other investments that the Fund holds will fall, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, or fail to rise. An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods.\\nNon-Diversified Fund Risk. The Fund is non-diversified, which generally means that it will invest a greater percentage of its total assets in the securities of fewer issuers than a \\u201cdiversified\\u201d fund. This increases the risk that a change in the value of any one investment held by the Fund could affect the overall value of the Fund more than it would affect that of a diversified fund holding a greater number of investments. Accordingly, the Fund's value will likely be more volatile than the value of a more diversified fund.\\nPROSPECTUS 2018\\t5\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA SELIGMAN COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION FUND\\nSUMMARY OF THE FUND (continued)\\nSector Risk. At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business within one or more economic sectors, including the technology and technology-related sectors. Companies in the same sector may be similarly affected by economic, regulatory, political or market events or conditions, which may make the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that sector than funds that invest more broadly. Generally, the more broadly the Fund invests, the more it spreads risk and potentially reduces the risks of loss and volatility.\\nInformation Technology and Technology-Related Sectors. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the information technology sector, as well as other technology-related sectors (collectively, the technology sectors) than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the technology sectors are subject to certain risks, including the risk that new services, equipment or technologies will not be accepted by consumers and businesses or will become rapidly obsolete. Performance of such companies may be affected by factors including obtaining and protecting patents (or the failure to do so) and significant competitive pressures, including aggressive pricing of their products or services, new market entrants, competition for market share and short product cycles due to an accelerated rate of technological developments. Such competitive pressures may lead to limited earnings and/or falling profit margins. As a result, the value of their securities may fall or fail to rise. In addition, many technology sector companies have limited operating histories and prices of these companies\\u2019 securities historically have been more volatile than other securities, especially over the short term.\\nSmall- and Mid-Cap Company Securities Risk. Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies (small- and mid-cap companies) often involve greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies (larger companies) because small- and mid-cap companies tend to have less predictable earnings and may lack the management experience, financial resources, product diversification and competitive strengths of larger companies. Securities of small- and mid-cap companies may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of larger companies.\\nPerformance Information\\nThe following bar chart and table show you how the Fund has performed in the past, and can help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the Fund\\u2019s Class A share performance (without sales charges) has varied for each full calendar year shown. If the sales charges were reflected, returns shown would be lower. The table below the bar chart compares the Fund\\u2019s returns (after applicable sales charges shown in the Shareholder Fees table in this prospectus) for the periods shown with a broad measure of market performance.\\nThe performance of one or more share classes shown in the table below begins before the indicated inception date for such share class. The returns shown for each such share class include the returns of the Fund\\u2019s Class A shares (without applicable sales charges and adjusted to reflect the higher class-related operating expenses of such share classes, where applicable) for periods prior to its inception date. Share classes with expenses that are higher than Class A shares will have performance that is lower than Class A shares (without sales charges). Except for differences in annual returns resulting from differences in expenses and sales charges (where applicable), the share classes of the Fund would have substantially similar annual returns because all share classes of the Fund invest in the same portfolio of securities.\\nThe after-tax returns shown in the Average Annual Total Returns table below are calculated using the highest historical individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates in effect during the period indicated in the table and do not reflect the impact of state, local or foreign taxes. Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your personal tax situation and may differ from those shown in the table. In addition, the after-tax returns shown in the table do not apply to shares held in tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k) plans or Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). The after-tax returns are shown only for Class A shares and will vary for other share classes.\\nThe Fund\\u2019s past performance (before and after taxes) is no guarantee of how the Fund will perform in the future.

There is no minimum additional investment for any share class.\\nTax Information\\nThe Fund normally distributes net investment income and net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders. These distributions are generally taxable to you as ordinary income, qualified dividend income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged account, such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA. If you are investing through a tax-advantaged account, you may be taxed upon withdrawals from that account.\\n8\\tPROSPECTUS 2018\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA SELIGMAN COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION FUND\\nSUMMARY OF THE FUND (continued)\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries\\nIf you purchase the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its related companies \\u2014 including Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (the Investment Manager), Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. (the Distributor) and Columbia Management Investment Services Corp. (the Transfer Agent) \\u2014 may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services.

The example assumes that you are not participating in the Fidelity\\u00ae systematic withdrawal plan.\\n\\nLet's say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that your shareholder fees and the annual operating expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated:\\n\\n1 year \\t$48 \\n3 years \\t$149 \\n5 years \\t$260 \\n10 years \\t$585 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe fund will not incur transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells shares of underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio), but it could incur transaction costs if it were to buy and sell other types of securities directly. If the fund were to buy and sell other types of securities directly, a higher portfolio turnover rate could indicate higher transaction costs and could result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. Such costs, if incurred, would not be reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example and would affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 46% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nInvesting primarily in a combination of Fidelity\\u00ae domestic equity funds, international equity funds, bond funds, and short-term funds (underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds) to seek to achieve the fund's investment objective consistent with a payment strategy to be administered through a complementary systematic withdrawal plan.\\nAllocating assets according to a stable neutral asset allocation strategy shown in the glide path below. FMR Co., Inc. (the Adviser) may modify the fund\\u2019s neutral asset allocations from time to time when in the interests of shareholders.\\nBuying and selling futures contracts (both long and short positions) in an effort to manage cash flows efficiently, remain fully invested, or facilitate asset allocation.\\n\\nAllocating assets among underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds and futures according to a stable neutral asset allocation of approximately:\\n   \\tDomestic Equity Funds* \\t17% \\n   \\tInternational Equity Funds* \\t7% \\n   \\tBond Funds* \\t46% \\n   \\tShort-Term Funds* \\t30% \\n\\n* The Adviser may change these percentages over time. As a result of the active asset allocation strategy (discussed below), actual allocations may differ from the neutral allocations above.\\n\\nThe Adviser may use an active asset allocation strategy to increase or decrease neutral asset class exposures reflected above by up to 10% for equity funds, bond funds and short-term funds to reflect the Adviser's market outlook, which is primarily focused on the intermediate term. The asset allocations in the glide path and pie chart above are referred to as neutral because they do not reflect any decisions made by the Adviser to overweight or underweight an asset class.\\nThe fund's investment objective is intended to support a payment strategy designed to be implemented through a shareholder's voluntary participation in a complementary systematic withdrawal plan that will enable shareholders to receive regular payments from the fund based on their expected required minimum distributions from certain types of retirement accounts as mandated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). However, shareholders may invest in the fund and not participate in the plan.\\n\\nInvestors should refer to the \\\"Features and Policies\\\" section of the prospectus for a summary of how the payment strategy and plan are designed to operate.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nThe fund is designed for investors who seek to convert accumulated assets into regular payments over time. A shareholder's participation in the systematic withdrawal plan will result in the gradual withdrawal of the value of the shareholder's account in the fund. The fund's share price fluctuates, which means you could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nAsset Allocation Risk.  The fund is subject to risks resulting from the Adviser's asset allocation decisions. If FMRC's asset allocation strategy does not work as intended, the fund may not achieve its objective. If the fund is unable to achieve its objective, the payment strategy may not work as intended. The selection of underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among various asset classes could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives. In addition, the fund's active asset allocation strategy may cause the fund to have a risk profile different than that portrayed above from time to time and may increase losses.\\nInvesting in Other Funds.  The fund bears all risks of investment strategies employed by the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives.\\nStock Market Volatility.  Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Different parts of the market, including different market sectors, and different types of securities can react differently to these developments.\\nInterest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt or money market security to decrease.\\nForeign Exposure.  Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, can be more volatile than the U.S. market due to increased risks of adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can perform differently from the U.S. market.\\nIndustry Exposure.  Market conditions, interest rates, and economic, regulatory, or financial developments could significantly affect a single industry or group of related industries.\\nPrepayment.  The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security's maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest rates change.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease. Lower-quality debt securities (those of less than investment-grade quality, also referred to as high yield debt securities or junk bonds) and certain types of other securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality of the issuer. The value of lower-quality debt securities and certain types of other securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.\\nCorrelation to Index.  The performance of an underlying index fund and its index may vary somewhat due to factors such as fees and expenses of the underlying fund, transaction costs, sample selection, regulatory restrictions, and timing differences associated with additions to and deletions from the index.\\nPassive Management Risk.  An underlying fund is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of an underlying fund's index or of the actual securities included in the index. This differs from an actively managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, an underlying fund's performance could be lower than actively managed funds that may shift their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers.\\nLeverage Risk.  Leverage can increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly.\\nInflation-Protected Debt Exposure.  Increases in real interest rates can cause the price of inflation-protected debt securities to decrease. Interest payments on inflation-protected debt securities can be unpredictable.\\nCommodity-Linked Investing.  The value of commodities and commodity-linked investments may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as weather, political, tax, and other regulatory and market developments. Commodity-linked investments may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying commodity, instruments, or measures.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund. The information illustrates the changes in the performance of the fund's shares from year to year and compares the performance of the fund's shares to the performance of a securities market index and an additional index over various periods of time.

Owners of variable insurance contracts that invest in the Shares should refer to the variable insurance contract prospectus for a description of fees and expenses, as the following table and examples do not reflect deductions at the separate account level or contract level for any charges that may be incurred under a contract. Inclusion of these charges would increase the fees and expenses described below.\\nANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\t \\t \\nManagement Fees\\t \\t0.64%\\nOther Expenses\\t \\t0.12%\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\t \\t0.76%\\n  \\nEXAMPLE:\\nThe Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Portfolio with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Portfolio for the time periods indicated, reinvest all dividends and distributions, and then redeem all of your Shares at the end of each period. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Portfolio\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n \\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nInstitutional Shares\\t$\\u200278\\t$\\u2002243\\t$\\u2002422\\t$\\u2002942\\n  \\nPortfolio Turnover:  The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Portfolio\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Portfolio\\u2019s turnover rate was 23% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES\\nThe Portfolio pursues its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of companies that the portfolio managers believe will benefit significantly from advances or improvements in technology. These companies generally fall into two categories:\\n\\u2022\\tcompanies that the portfolio managers believe have or will develop products, processes, or services that will provide significant technological advancements or improvements; and\\n\\u2022\\tcompanies that the portfolio managers believe rely extensively on technology in connection with their operations or services.\\nSome of the industries and companies likely to be represented in the Portfolio\\u2019s holdings include e-commerce (companies doing business through the Internet); computer (hardware and software); communications (voice, data, and wireless); industrials; Internet (software, services, and infrastructure equipment); and media and entertainment.\\nThe Portfolio implements this policy by investing primarily in equity securities of U.S. and foreign companies selected for their growth potential. The Portfolio typically invests at least 40% of its net assets in securities of issuers or companies that are economically tied to different countries throughout the world, excluding the United States. The Portfolio may, under\\n41\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson Global Technology Portfolio\\n \\n\\nunusual circumstances, invest in a single country. The Portfolio may have significant exposure to emerging markets. The Portfolio may also invest in U.S. and foreign debt securities. From time to time, the Portfolio may invest in shares of companies through initial public offerings.\\nThe portfolio managers apply a \\u201cbottom up\\u201d approach in choosing investments. In other words, the portfolio managers look at companies one at a time to determine if a company is an attractive investment opportunity and if it is consistent with the Portfolio\\u2019s investment policies.\\nThe Portfolio may also take long or short positions in derivatives, which are instruments that have a value derived from, or directly linked to, an underlying asset, such as equity securities, fixed-income securities, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indices. For purposes of meeting its 80% investment policy, the Portfolio may include derivatives that have characteristics similar to the securities in which the Portfolio may directly invest. The types of derivatives in which the Portfolio may invest include options, futures, swaps, warrants, and forward currency contracts. The Portfolio may use derivatives to hedge, to earn income or enhance returns, as a substitute for securities in which the Portfolio invests, to increase or decrease the Portfolio\\u2019s exposure to a particular market, to adjust the Portfolio\\u2019s currency exposure relative to its benchmark index, to gain access to foreign markets where direct investment may be restricted or unavailable, or to manage the Portfolio\\u2019s risk profile.\\nThe Portfolio may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, in an amount equal to up to one-third of its total assets as determined at the time of the loan origination.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS\\nThe biggest risk is that the Portfolio\\u2019s returns will vary, and you could lose money. The Portfolio is designed for long-term investors seeking an equity portfolio, including common stocks. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than many other investment choices.\\nForeign Exposure Risk.  The Portfolio normally has significant exposure to foreign markets as a result of its investments in foreign securities, including investments in emerging markets, which can be more volatile than the U.S. markets. As a result, its returns and net asset value may be affected to a large degree by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or political or economic conditions in a particular country. In some foreign markets, there may not be protection against failure by other parties to complete transactions. It may not be possible for the Portfolio to repatriate capital, dividends, interest, and other income from a particular country or governmental entity. In addition, a market swing in one or more countries or regions where the Portfolio has invested a significant amount of its assets may have a greater effect on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance than it would in a more geographically diversified portfolio. To the extent the Portfolio invests in foreign debt securities, such investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Additionally, investments in securities of foreign governments involve the risk that a foreign government may not be willing or able to pay interest or repay principal when due. The Portfolio\\u2019s investments in emerging market countries may involve risks greater than, or in addition to, the risks of investing in more developed countries.\\nEmerging Markets Risk.  The risks of foreign investing mentioned above are heightened when investing in emerging markets. Emerging markets securities involve a number of additional risks, which may result from less government supervision and regulation of business and industry practices (including the potential lack of strict finance and accounting controls and standards), stock exchanges, brokers, and listed companies, making these investments potentially more volatile in price and less liquid than investments in developed securities markets, resulting in greater risk to investors. There is a risk in developing countries that a future economic or political crisis could lead to price controls, forced mergers of companies, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition or enforcement of foreign ownership limits, seizure, nationalization, sanctions or imposition of restrictions by various governmental entities on investment and trading, or creation of government monopolies, any of which may have a detrimental effect on the Portfolio\\u2019s investments. In addition, the Portfolio\\u2019s investments may be denominated in foreign currencies and therefore, changes in the value of a country\\u2019s currency compared to the U.S. dollar may affect the value of the Portfolio\\u2019s investments. To the extent that the Portfolio invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of emerging markets issuers in or companies of a single country or region, it is more likely to be impacted by events or conditions affecting that country or region, which could have a negative impact on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance. Some of the risks of investing directly in foreign and emerging market securities may be reduced when the Portfolio invests indirectly in foreign securities through various other investment vehicles including derivatives, which also\\n42\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson Global Technology Portfolio\\n \\n\\ninvolve other risks. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 16.2% of the Portfolio\\u2019s investments were in emerging markets (i.e., countries included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm).\\nMarket Risk.  The value of the Portfolio\\u2019s holdings may decrease if the value of an individual company or security, or multiple companies or securities, in the Portfolio decreases or if the portfolio managers\\u2019 belief about a company\\u2019s intrinsic worth is incorrect. Further, regardless of how well individual companies or securities perform, the value of the Portfolio\\u2019s holdings could also decrease if there are deteriorating economic or market conditions. It is important to understand that the value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, in response to changes in the market, and you could lose money. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, economic sector, or the market as a whole.\\nGrowth Securities Risk.  The Portfolio invests in companies that the portfolio managers believe have growth potential. Securities of companies perceived to be \\u201cgrowth\\u201d companies may be more volatile than other stocks and may involve special risks. If the portfolio managers\\u2019 perception of a company\\u2019s growth potential is not realized, the securities purchased may not perform as expected, reducing the Portfolio\\u2019s returns. In addition, because different types of stocks tend to shift in and out of favor depending on market and economic conditions, \\u201cgrowth\\u201d stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of securities.\\nIndustry Risk.  Although the Portfolio does not concentrate its investments in specific industries or industry sectors, it may invest in companies related in such a way that they react similarly to certain market pressures. As a result, the Portfolio\\u2019s returns may be considerably more volatile than the returns of a fund that does not invest in similarly related companies.\\nDerivatives Risk.  Derivatives can be highly volatile and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying referenced securities or asset. Gains or losses from a derivative investment can be substantially greater than the derivative\\u2019s original cost, and can therefore involve leverage. Leverage may cause the Portfolio to be more volatile than if it had not used leverage. Derivatives can be complex instruments and may involve analysis that differs from that required for other investment types used by the Portfolio. If the value of a derivative does not correlate well with the particular market or other asset class to which the derivative is intended to provide exposure, the derivative may not produce the anticipated result. Derivatives can also reduce the opportunity for gain or result in losses by offsetting positive returns in other investments. Derivatives can be less liquid than other types of investments and entail the risk that the counterparty will default on its payment obligations. If the counterparty to a derivative transaction defaults, the Portfolio would risk the loss of the net amount of the payments that it contractually is entitled to receive. To the extent the Portfolio enters into short derivative positions, the Portfolio may be exposed to risks similar to those associated with short sales, including the risk that the Portfolio\\u2019s losses are theoretically unlimited. Hedging with derivatives may increase expenses, and there is no guarantee that a hedging strategy will work. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains or cause losses if the market moves in a manner different from that anticipated by the Portfolio or if the cost of the derivative outweighs the benefit of the hedge.\\nGeographic Concentration Risk.  To the extent the Portfolio invests a substantial amount of its assets in issuers located in a single country or region, the economic, political, social, regulatory or other developments or conditions within such country or region will generally have a greater effect on the Portfolio than they would on a more geographically diversified fund, which may result in greater losses and volatility. Adverse developments in certain regions could also adversely affect securities of other countries whose economies appear to be unrelated and could have a negative impact on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance.\\nInitial Public Offering Risk.  The Portfolio\\u2019s purchase of shares issued in an initial public offering (\\u201cIPO\\u201d) exposes it to the risks associated with companies that have little operating history as public companies, as well as to the risks inherent in those sectors of the market where these new issuers operate. Although IPO investments may have had a positive impact on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance in the past, there can be no assurance that the Portfolio will identify favorable IPO investment opportunities in the future. In addition, as the Portfolio increases in size, the impact of IPOs on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance will generally decrease.\\nMid-Sized Companies Risk.  The Portfolio\\u2019s investments in securities issued by mid-sized companies may involve greater risks than are customarily associated with larger, more established companies. Securities issued by mid-sized companies tend to be more volatile than securities issued by larger or more established companies and may underperform as compared to the securities of larger or more established companies.\\nSecurities Lending Risk.  The Portfolio may seek to earn additional income through lending its securities to certain qualified broker-dealers and institutions. There is the risk that when portfolio securities are lent, the securities may not be returned on a timely basis, and the Portfolio may experience delays and costs in recovering the security or gaining access to the collateral\\n43\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson Global Technology Portfolio\\n \\n\\nprovided to the Portfolio to collateralize the loan. If the Portfolio is unable to recover a security on loan, the Portfolio may use the collateral to purchase replacement securities in the market. There is a risk that the value of the collateral could decrease below the cost of the replacement security by the time the replacement investment is made, resulting in a loss to the Portfolio.\\nManagement Risk.  The Portfolio is an actively managed investment portfolio and is therefore subject to the risk that the investment strategies employed for the Portfolio may fail to produce the intended results. The Portfolio may underperform its benchmark index or other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.\\nAn investment in the Portfolio is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nPERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\nThe following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Portfolio by showing how the Portfolio\\u2019s performance has varied over time. The bar chart depicts the change in performance from year to year during the periods indicated, but does not include charges or expenses attributable to any insurance product, which would lower the performance illustrated. The Portfolio does not impose any sales or other charges that would affect total return computations. Total return figures include the effect of the Portfolio\\u2019s expenses. The table compares the average annual returns for the Institutional Shares of the Portfolio for the periods indicated to broad-based securities market indices. All figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions. For certain periods, the Portfolio\\u2019s performance reflects the effect of expense waivers. Without the effect of these expense waivers, the performance shown would have been lower.\\nThe Portfolio\\u2019s past performance does not necessarily indicate how it will perform in the future.

J. Bradley Slingerlend, CFA, is Executive Vice President and Co-Portfolio Manager of the Portfolio, which he has managed or co-managed since May 2011.\\nPURCHASE AND SALE OF PORTFOLIO SHARES\\nPurchases of Shares may be made only by the separate accounts of insurance companies for the purpose of funding variable insurance contracts or by certain qualified retirement plans. Redemptions, like purchases, may be effected only through the separate accounts of participating insurance companies or through qualified retirement plans. Requests are duly processed at the NAV next calculated after your order is received in good order by the Portfolio or its agents. Refer to the appropriate separate account prospectus or plan documents for details.\\nTAX INFORMATION\\nBecause Shares of the Portfolio may be purchased only through variable insurance contracts and certain qualified retirement plans, it is anticipated that any income dividends or net capital gains distributions made by the Portfolio will be exempt from current federal income taxation if left to accumulate within the variable insurance contract or qualified retirement plan. The federal income tax status of your investment depends on the features of your qualified retirement plan or variable insurance contract.\\nPAYMENTS TO INSURERS, BROKER-DEALERS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES\\nPortfolio shares are generally available only through an insurer\\u2019s variable contracts, or through certain employer or other retirement plans (Retirement Products). Retirement Products are generally purchased through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary. The Portfolio or its distributor (and/or their related companies) may make payments to the insurer and/or its related companies for distribution and/or other services; some of the payments may go to broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries. These payments may create a conflict of interest for an intermediary, or be a factor in the insurer\\u2019s decision to include the Portfolio as an underlying investment option in a variable contract. Ask your financial advisor, visit your intermediary\\u2019s website, or consult your insurance contract prospectus for more information.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows.\\n\\n\\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses\\n\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\n\\nManagement fees \\t0.40% \\nDistribution and service (12b-1) fees \\tNone \\nOther expenses1 \\tNone \\nTotal annual Fund operating expenses1 \\t0.40% \\n1. Expenses have been restated to reflect current fees.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nThis Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of the period. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n   \\t1 Year \\t3 Years \\t5 Years \\t10 Years \\n   \\t$ 41 \\t$ 128 \\t$ 224 \\t$ 505 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual Fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 32.55% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index and in depositary receipts representing such securities. The International Equity Hedged Underlying Index is a systematic, rules-based proprietary index that is owned and calculated by MSCI Inc. (MSCI). The International Equity Hedged Underlying Index is based on the MSCI EAFE Index using a methodology developed with Franklin Templeton to reflect Franklin Templeton\\u2019s desired investment strategy. The MSCI EAFE Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets, excluding the U.S. and Canada.\\n\\nThe International Equity Hedged Underlying Index includes stocks from developed market countries in Europe, Australasia and the Far East that have favorable exposure to multiple investment style factors. The International Equity Hedged Underlying Index seeks to achieve a lower level of risk and higher risk-adjusted performance than the MSCI EAFE Index over the long term by applying a multi-factor selection process, which is designed to select equity securities from the MSCI EAFE Index that have favorable exposure to four investment style factors \\u2013 quality, value, momentum and low volatility. Factors are common characteristics that relate to a group of issuers or securities that are important in explaining the returns and risks of those issuers\\u2019 securities. The \\u201cquality\\u201d factor incorporates measurements such as return on equity, earnings variability, cash return on assets and leverage. The \\u201cvalue\\u201d factor incorporates measurements such as price to earnings, price to forward earnings, price to book value and dividend yield. The \\u201cmomentum\\u201d factor incorporates measurements such as 6-month risk adjusted price momentum and 12-month risk-adjusted price momentum. The \\u201clow volatility\\u201d factor incorporates measurements such as historical beta (i.e., a measure of the volatility of a security relative to the total market). The International Equity Hedged Underlying Index incorporates a hedge against the currency risk of the securities included in the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index against the U.S. dollar.\\n\\nAt the time of each semi-annual reconstitution of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index, no company shall comprise more than 2% of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index. The International Equity Hedged Underlying Index is also constrained in its construction to limit turnover of constituent securities at each semi-annual reconstitution. The International Equity Hedged Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of June 29, 2018, the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index was comprised of 251 securities with capitalizations ranging from $2.16 billion to $211.22 billion.\\n\\nThe Fund, using a \\u201cpassive\\u201d or indexing investment approach, seeks investment results that closely correspond, before fees and expenses, to the performance of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index. The investment manager seeks to achieve, over time, a correlation between the Fund\\u2019s performance, before fees and expenses, and that of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index of 0.95 or better. A figure of 1.00 would indicate perfect correlation. The Fund\\u2019s intention is to replicate the component securities of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index as closely as possible (i.e., invest in all of the component securities in their respective weightings in the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index). However, under various circumstances, it may not be possible or practicable to replicate the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index. In these circumstances, the Fund may use a \\u201crepresentative sampling\\u201d strategy whereby the Fund would invest in what it believes to be a representative sample of the component securities of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index, but may not track the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index with the same degree of accuracy as would an investment vehicle replicating the entire International Equity Hedged Underlying Index. Under the representative sampling technique, the investment manager will select securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to that of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index, including securities that resemble those included in the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index in terms of risk factors, performance attributes and other characteristics, such as market capitalization and industry weightings. The Fund\\u2019s portfolio is reconstituted semi-annually following the semi-annual reconstitution of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index.\\n\\nThe International Equity Hedged Underlying Index incorporates a hedge against non-U.S. currency fluctuations by reflecting the impact of rolling monthly currency forward contracts on the currencies represented in the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index (the \\u201chedge impact\\u201d). The return of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index is calculated as the sum of the return of the corresponding unhedged index denominated in U.S. dollars plus the hedge impact. The International Equity Hedged Underlying Index is calculated as if it sells forward the total value of the non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index at a one-month forward rate to effectively create a hedge against fluctuations in the relative value of each of the component currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge is reset on a monthly basis by simulating the setting up of a similar transaction in which the notional amount of the forwards sold represents the new month-end value of the non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index. No adjustment to the hedge is made during the month to account for changes in the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index due to price movement of securities, corporate events, additions, deletions or any other changes (i.e., the amount hedged is kept constant over the whole month). The International Equity Hedged Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged index when the component currencies are weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index will have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged index when the component currencies are rising relative to the U.S. dollar.\\n\\nThe Fund intends to enter into monthly foreign currency forward contracts and/or currency futures contracts designed to offset the Fund\\u2019s exposure to the component currencies, in order to replicate the hedge impact incorporated in the calculation of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index. The Fund\\u2019s exposure to foreign currency forward contracts and currency futures contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the component currencies.\\n\\nThe Fund will concentrate its investments (i.e., hold 25% or more of its net assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index is concentrated.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nYou could lose money by investing in the Fund. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank, and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other agency of the U.S. government. The Fund is subject to the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund\\u2019s net asset value (NAV), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment goal.\\n\\nMarket   The market values of securities or other investments owned by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The market value of a security or other investment may be reduced by market activity or other results of supply and demand unrelated to the issuer. This is a basic risk associated with all investments. When there are more sellers than buyers, prices tend to fall. Likewise, when there are more buyers than sellers, prices tend to rise.\\n\\nStock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of debt securities. A slower-growth or recessionary economic environment could have an adverse effect on the prices of the various stocks held by the Fund.\\n\\nInvestment Style Factors   There can be no assurance that the multi-factor stock selection process of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index will enhance performance. Exposure to such investment factors may detract from performance in some market environments, perhaps for extended periods.\\n\\nForeign Securities (non-U.S.)   Investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in U.S. securities, and includes risks associated with: (i) internal and external political and economic developments \\u2013 e.g., the political, economic and social policies and structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S. or some foreign countries may be subject to trading restrictions or economic sanctions; (ii) trading practices \\u2013 e.g., government supervision and regulation of foreign securities and currency markets, trading systems and brokers may be less than in the U.S.; (iii) availability of information \\u2013 e.g., foreign issuers may not be subject to the same disclosure, accounting and financial reporting standards and practices as U.S. issuers; (iv) limited markets \\u2013 e.g., the securities of certain foreign issuers may be less liquid (harder to sell) and more volatile; and (v) currency exchange rate fluctuations and policies (e.g., fluctuations may negatively affect investments denominated in foreign currencies and any income received or expenses paid by the Fund in that foreign currency).\\n\\nCurrency Hedging   In seeking investment results that closely correspond, before fees and expenses, to the performance of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index, the Fund will attempt to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio by investing in foreign currency forward contracts and/or currency futures contracts. While this approach is designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund's exposure to the component currencies. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts and currency futures contracts will not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations between the component currencies and the U.S. dollar. Moreover, while currency hedging can reduce or eliminate losses due to exchange rate changes, it can also reduce or eliminate gains, and the Fund bears additional transaction costs in entering into derivative instruments. Currency hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative instruments and the currencies that the derivative instruments intend to hedge, and there can be no assurance that the Fund's hedging transactions will be effective. The Fund\\u2019s exposure to the component currencies may not be fully hedged at all times.\\n\\nBecause the Fund's currency hedge is generally reset on a monthly basis, currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. The Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund's portfolio in a way that tracks the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index.\\n\\nIncreased volatility of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index or the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies being hedged will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund's currency hedging strategy, measured on an aggregate basis. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates may impact the effectiveness of the Fund's currency hedging strategy.\\n\\nDerivative Instruments   The performance of derivative instruments (including currency derivatives) depends largely on the performance of an underlying currency, security, interest rate or index, and such derivatives often have risks similar to the underlying instrument, in addition to other risks. Derivatives involve costs and can create economic leverage in the Fund\\u2019s portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the Fund to participate in losses (as well as gains) in an amount that significantly exceeds the Fund\\u2019s initial investment. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial investment. Other risks include illiquidity, mispricing or improper valuation of the derivative, and imperfect correlation between the value of the derivative and the underlying instrument so that the Fund may not realize the intended benefits. Their successful use will usually depend on the investment manager\\u2019s ability to accurately forecast movements in the market relating to the underlying instrument. Should a market or markets, or prices of particular classes of investments move in an unexpected manner, especially in unusual or extreme market conditions, the Fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and it may realize losses, which could be significant. If the investment manager is not successful in using such derivative instruments, the Fund\\u2019s performance may be worse than if the investment manager did not use such derivatives at all. When a derivative is used for hedging, the change in value of the derivative may also not correlate specifically with the currency, security, interest rate, index or other risk being hedged. Derivatives also may present the risk that the other party to the transaction will fail to perform. There is also the risk, especially under extreme market conditions, that a derivative, which usually would operate as a hedge, provides no hedging benefits at all.\\n\\nRegional   The Fund will invest in specific countries or geographic regions to approximately the same extent as the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index. To the extent that the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in a specific geographic region or a particular country, the Fund will generally have more exposure to the specific regional or country economic risks. In the event of economic or political turmoil or a deterioration of diplomatic relations in a region or country where a substantial portion of the Fund\\u2019s assets are invested, the Fund may experience substantial illiquidity or reduction in the value of the Fund\\u2019s investments. Adverse conditions in a certain region or country can also adversely affect securities of issuers in other countries whose economies appear to be unrelated.\\n\\nDepositary Receipts   Depositary receipts are subject to many of the risks of the underlying securities. For some depositary receipts, the custodian or similar financial institution that holds the issuer's shares in a trust account is located in the issuer's home country. In these cases if the issuer\\u2019s home country does not have developed financial markets, the Fund could be exposed to the credit risk of the custodian or financial institution and greater market risk. In addition, the depository institution may not have physical custody of the underlying securities at all times and may charge fees for various services. The Fund may experience delays in receiving its dividend and interest payments or exercising rights as a shareholder. There may be an increased possibility of untimely responses to certain corporate actions of the issuer in an unsponsored depositary receipt program. Accordingly, there may be less information available regarding issuers of securities underlying unsponsored programs and there may not be a correlation between this information and the market value of the depositary receipts.\\n\\nCalculation Methodology   The International Equity Hedged Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index (or the MSCI index on which it is based), including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor the investment manager can offer assurances that the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index\\u2019s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included issuers or that the included issuers will provide the Fund with the market exposure it seeks.\\n\\nIndex-Related   There is no assurance that the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While MSCI provides descriptions of what the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index is designed to achieve, MSCI does not guarantee the quality, accuracy or completeness of data in respect of its indices, and does not guarantee that the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index will be in line with the described index methodology. Gains, losses or costs to the Fund caused by errors in the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index may therefore be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.\\n\\nNon-Correlation   There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index and therefore achieve its investment goal. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund\\u2019s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund\\u2019s NAV may deviate from the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index if the Fund fair values a portfolio security at a price other than the price used by the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index for that security. To the extent that the investment manager uses a representative sampling strategy, the Fund may not track the return of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index as well as it would have if the Fund held all of the securities in the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index.\\n\\nTracking Error   Tracking error is the divergence of the Fund\\u2019s performance from that of the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities held in the Fund\\u2019s portfolio and those included in the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index, pricing differences (including differences between a security\\u2019s price at the local market close and the Fund\\u2019s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund\\u2019s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the Fund\\u2019s holding of cash, differences in timing of the accrual of dividends or interest, tax gains or losses, changes to the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index or the need to meet various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods.\\n\\nMarket Trading   The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation/redemption process of the Fund. Any of these factors, among others, may lead to the Fund\\u2019s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV. Thus, you may pay more (or less) than NAV when you buy shares of the Fund in the secondary market, and you may receive less (or more) than NAV when you sell those shares in the secondary market. The investment manager cannot predict whether shares will trade above (premium), below (discount) or at NAV.\\n\\nConcentration   To the extent the Fund concentrates in a specific industry, a group of industries, sector or type of investment, the Fund will carry much greater risks of adverse developments and price movements in such industries, sectors or investments than a fund that invests in a wider variety of industries, sectors or investments. There is also the risk that the Fund will perform poorly during a slump in demand for securities of companies in such industries or sectors.\\n\\nMidsize Companies   Securities issued by midsize companies may be more volatile in price than those of larger companies, involve substantial risks and should be considered speculative. Such risks may include greater sensitivity to economic conditions, less certain growth prospects, lack of depth of management and funds for growth and development, and limited or less developed product lines and markets. In addition, midsize companies may be particularly affected by interest rate increases, as they may find it more difficult to borrow money to continue or expand operations, or may have difficulty in repaying any loans.\\n\\nPassive Investment   Unlike many investment companies, the Fund is not actively managed and the investment manager does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. Therefore, the investment manager would not necessarily buy or sell a security unless that security is added or removed, respectively, from the International Equity Hedged Underlying Index, even if that security generally is underperforming.\\n\\nInternational Closed Market Trading   To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund trade on an exchange that is closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund shares list and trade is open, there may be market uncertainty about the stale security pricing (i.e., the last quote from its closed foreign market) resulting in premiums or discounts to NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.\\n\\nAuthorized Participant Concentration   Only an authorized participant (Authorized Participant) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that act as Authorized Participants. To the extent that these institutions exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation and/or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined below), Fund shares may trade at a discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts and/or delisting. This risk may be more pronounced in volatile markets, potentially where there are significant redemptions in ETFs generally.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by comparing the Fund's performance with that of the Fund's underlying index and a broad measure of market performance.

Fund shares may only be purchased and sold on a national securities exchange through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund issues or redeems shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 100,000 shares or multiples thereof (Creation Units) to Authorized Participants who have entered into agreements with the Fund\\u2019s distributor, Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. The Fund will generally issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a basket of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.\\n\\nTaxes\\n\\nThe Fund\\u2019s distributions are generally taxable to you as ordinary income, capital gains, or some combination of both, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account, in which case your distributions would generally be taxed when withdrawn from the tax-deferred account.\\n\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and\\nOther Financial Intermediaries\\n\\nIf you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), Advisers or other related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\",\n          \"Fund Summary\\n\\nFund/Class:\\nFidelity Simplicity RMD 2020 Fund\\u2120/Fidelity Simplicity RMD 2020 Fund\\u2120\\n\\nInvestment Objective\\n\\nThe fund seeks total return until its horizon date through a combination of current income and capital growth. Thereafter, the fund\\u2019s objective will be to seek high current income and, as a secondary objective, capital appreciation.\\n\\nFee Table\\n\\nThe following table describes the fees and expenses that may be incurred when you buy and hold shares of the fund.\\n\\nShareholder fees\\n\\n(fees paid directly from your investment) \\tNone \\nAnnual Operating Expenses\\n\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a % of the value of your investment)\\n\\nManagement fee(a) \\t \\t0.61% \\nDistribution and/or Service (12b-1) fees \\t \\tNone \\nOther expenses(a) \\t \\t0.00% \\nTotal annual operating expenses(a) \\t \\t0.61% \\n(a)   Adjusted to reflect current fees.\\n\\nThis example helps compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other funds. The example assumes that you are not participating in the Fidelity\\u00ae systematic withdrawal plan.\\n\\nLet's say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that your shareholder fees and the annual operating expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated:\\n\\n1 year \\t$62 \\n3 years \\t$193 \\n5 years \\t$330 \\n10 years \\t$711 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe fund will not incur transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells shares of underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio), but it could incur transaction costs if it were to buy and sell other types of securities directly. If the fund were to buy and sell other types of securities directly, a higher portfolio turnover rate could indicate higher transaction costs and could result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. Such costs, if incurred, would not be reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example and would affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 29% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nInvesting primarily in a combination of Fidelity\\u00ae domestic equity funds, international equity funds, bond funds, and short-term funds (underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds) to seek to achieve the fund's investment objective consistent with a payment strategy to be administered through a complementary systematic withdrawal plan.\\nAllocating assets according to a neutral asset allocation strategy shown in the glide path below that adjusts over time until it reaches an allocation similar to that of the Fidelity Simplicity RMD Income Fund\\u2120, approximately 10 to 20 years after the year 2020. FMR Co., Inc. (the Adviser) may modify the fund\\u2019s neutral asset allocations from time to time when in the interests of shareholders.\\nBuying and selling futures contracts (both long and short positions) in an effort to manage cash flows efficiently, remain fully invested, or facilitate asset allocation.\\nThe Adviser may continue to seek total return for several years beyond the fund's horizon date in an effort to achieve the fund's overall investment objective.\\n\\nAs of July 31, 2018, the fund's neutral asset allocation to underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds and futures was approximately:\\n   \\tDomestic Equity Funds* \\t35% \\n   \\tInternational Equity Funds* \\t15% \\n   \\tBond Funds* \\t40% \\n   \\tShort-Term Funds* \\t10% \\n\\n* The Adviser may change these percentages over time. As a result of the active asset allocation strategy (discussed below), actual allocations may differ from the neutral allocations above. The allocation percentages may not add to 100% due to rounding.\\n\\nThe Adviser may use an active asset allocation strategy to increase or decrease neutral asset class exposures reflected above by up to 10% for equity funds, bond funds and short-term funds to reflect the Adviser's market outlook, which is primarily focused on the intermediate term. The asset allocations in the glide path and pie chart above are referred to as neutral because they do not reflect any decisions made by the Adviser to overweight or underweight an asset class.\\nDesigned for investors approaching age 70 and \\u00bd and above who will turn age 70 in or within a few years of 2020 (horizon date) and plan to gradually withdraw the value of their account in the fund over time (in accordance with minimum distribution requirements as mandated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)).\\nThe fund's investment objective is intended to support a payment strategy designed to be implemented through a shareholder's voluntary participation in a complementary systematic withdrawal plan that will enable shareholders to receive regular payments from the fund based on their expected required minimum distributions from certain types of retirement accounts as mandated by the IRS. However, shareholders may invest in the fund and not participate in the plan.\\n\\nInvestors should refer to the \\\"Features and Policies\\\" section of the prospectus for a summary of how the payment strategy and plan are designed to operate.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nThe fund is designed for investors who seek to convert accumulated assets into regular payments over time. A shareholder's participation in the systematic withdrawal plan will result in the gradual withdrawal of the value of the shareholder's account in the fund. The fund's share price fluctuates, which means you could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nAsset Allocation Risk.  The fund is subject to risks resulting from the Adviser's asset allocation decisions. If FMRC's asset allocation strategy does not work as intended, the fund may not achieve its objective. If the fund is unable to achieve its objective, the payment strategy may not work as intended. The selection of underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among various asset classes could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives. In addition, the fund's active asset allocation strategy may cause the fund to have a risk profile different than that portrayed above from time to time and may increase losses.\\nInvesting in Other Funds.  The fund bears all risks of investment strategies employed by the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives.\\nStock Market Volatility.  Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Different parts of the market, including different market sectors, and different types of securities can react differently to these developments.\\nInterest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt or money market security to decrease.\\nForeign Exposure.  Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, can be more volatile than the U.S. market due to increased risks of adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can perform differently from the U.S. market. Emerging markets can be subject to greater social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties and can be extremely volatile. Foreign exchange rates also can be extremely volatile.\\nIndustry Exposure.  Market conditions, interest rates, and economic, regulatory, or financial developments could significantly affect a single industry or group of related industries.\\nPrepayment.  The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security's maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest rates change.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease. Lower-quality debt securities (those of less than investment-grade quality, also referred to as high yield debt securities or junk bonds) and certain types of other securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality of the issuer. The value of lower-quality debt securities and certain types of other securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.\\nCorrelation to Index.  The performance of an underlying index fund and its index may vary somewhat due to factors such as fees and expenses of the underlying fund, transaction costs, sample selection, regulatory restrictions, and timing differences associated with additions to and deletions from the index.\\nPassive Management Risk.  An underlying fund is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of an underlying fund's index or of the actual securities included in the index. This differs from an actively managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, an underlying fund's performance could be lower than actively managed funds that may shift their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers.\\nLeverage Risk.  Leverage can increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly.\\n\\\"Growth\\\" Investing.  \\\"Growth\\\" stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of stocks and can be more volatile than other types of stocks.\\n\\\"Value\\\" Investing.  \\\"Value\\\" stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.\\nCommodity-Linked Investing.  The value of commodities and commodity-linked investments may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as weather, political, tax, and other regulatory and market developments. Commodity-linked investments may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying commodity, instruments, or measures.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund.

The target date is meant to roughly correspond to the year in which the fund beneficiary will start to withdraw funds to meet higher education expenses. The fund will increasingly emphasize income and preservation of capital by investing a greater portion of its assets in bond, equity-income and balanced funds as it approaches and passes its target date. In this way, the fund seeks to achieve an appropriate balance of total return and stability during different time periods.\\n\\nFees and expenses of the fund This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. You may qualify for a Class 529-A sales charge discount if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $100,000 in American Funds.

The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 10% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund will attempt to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a mix of American Funds in different combinations and weightings. The underlying American Funds represent a variety of fund categories such as growth funds, growth-and-income funds, equity-income funds, balanced funds and bond funds. The fund categories represent differing investment objectives. For example, growth funds seek long-term growth primarily through investing in both U.S. stocks and stocks of issuers domiciled outside the U.S. Growth-and-income funds seek long-term growth-and-income primarily through investments in stocks. Equity-income and balanced funds generally strive for income and growth through stocks and/or bond investments, while bond funds seek current income through bond investments. The fund is designed for investors who plan to attend college in, or close to, the year designated in the fund\\u2019s name.\\n\\nThe investment adviser may periodically rebalance or modify the asset mix of the funds and change the underlying fund investments. According to its current investment approach, the percentage of the fund invested in different categories will change until the fund reaches its target date. Upon reaching its target date, the fund will be principally invested in fixed-income funds and may merge into the Enrollment Fund, which will also be principally invested in fixed-income funds.\\n\\nThe fund\\u2019s investment adviser periodically reviews the investment strategies and asset mix of the underlying funds. The investment adviser will also consider whether overall market conditions would favor a change in the exposure of the fund to various asset types or geographic regions. Based on these considerations, the investment adviser may make adjustments to underlying fund holdings by adjusting the percentage of individual underlying funds within the fund, or adding or removing underlying funds. The investment adviser may also determine not to change the underlying fund allocations, particularly in response to short-term market movements, if in its opinion the combination of underlying funds is appropriate to meet the fund\\u2019s investment objective.\\n\\nWith respect to its fixed-income investments, the underlying funds in which the fund invests may hold debt securities with a wide range of quality and maturities. The fund may invest in underlying funds with significant exposure to bonds rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser, or unrated but determined by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser to be of equivalent quality. Securities rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below are sometimes referred to as \\u201cjunk bonds.\\u201d Exposure to lower rated securities may help the fund achieve its objective of providing current income.\\n\\nThe underlying funds may hold securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government, securities issued by federal agencies and instrumentalities and securities backed by mortgages or other assets. The underlying funds may also invest in the debt securities of governments, agencies, corporations and other entities domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\n23     American Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nThe following chart illustrates the investment approach of the fund by showing how its investment in the various fund categories will change over time. The allocations shown reflect the fund\\u2019s target allocations as of January 1, 2019.\\n\\nInvestment approach\\n\\n\\n\\nThe investment adviser anticipates that the fund will invest its assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below the investment approach set forth above. For example, a 20% target allocation to growth funds is not expected to be greater than 30% or less than 10%. The investment adviser will continuously monitor the fund and may make modifications to either the investment approach or the underlying fund allocations that the investment adviser believes could benefit shareholders.\\n\\nPrincipal risks This section describes the principal risks associated with investing in the fund and its underlying funds. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s investment strategies.\\n\\nAllocation risk \\u2014 Investments in the fund are subject to risks related to the investment adviser\\u2019s allocation choices. The selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund\\u2019s assets could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nFund structure \\u2014 The fund invests in underlying funds and incurs expenses related to the underlying funds. In addition, investors in the fund will incur fees to pay for certain expenses related to the operations of the fund. An investor holding the underlying funds directly and in the same proportions as the fund would incur lower overall expenses but would not receive the benefit of the portfolio management and other services provided by the fund.\\n\\nUnderlying fund risks \\u2014 Because the fund\\u2019s investments consist of underlying funds, the fund\\u2019s risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. For this reason, it is important to understand the risks associated with investing in the underlying funds, as described below.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the underlying funds\\u2019 investment strategies.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks, bonds and other securities held by the underlying funds may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental, governmental agency or central bank responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the underlying funds may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance, major litigation against the issuer, changes in government regulations affecting the issuer or its competitive environment and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nAmerican Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus     24\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in stocks \\u2014 Investing in stocks may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments. As a result, the value of the underlying funds may be subject to sharp, short-term declines in value. Income provided by an underlying fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available at, the companies in which the underlying fund invests. As the fund nears its target date, a decreasing proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will be invested in underlying funds that invest primarily in stocks. Accordingly, these risks are expected to be more significant the further the fund is removed from its target date and are expected to lessen as the fund approaches its target date.\\n\\nInvesting in debt instruments \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, bonds and other debt securities held by an underlying fund may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the effective maturities and credit ratings of these securities.\\n\\nRising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. A general rise in interest rates may cause investors to sell debt securities on a large scale, which could also adversely affect the price and liquidity of debt securities and could also result in increased redemptions from the fund. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund failing to recoup the full amount of its initial investment and having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities generally have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter maturity debt securities.\\n\\nBonds and other debt securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer or guarantor will weaken or be perceived to be weaker, and/or an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default. A downgrade or default affecting any of the underlying funds\\u2019 securities could cause the value of the underlying funds\\u2019 shares to decrease. Credit risk is gauged, in part, by the credit ratings of the debt securities in which the underlying fund invests. However, ratings are only the opinions of the rating agencies issuing them and are not guarantees as to credit quality or an evaluation of market risk. The underlying funds\\u2019 investment adviser relies on its own credit analysts to research issuers and issues in seeking to assess credit and default risks. These risks will be more significant as the fund approaches its target date because a greater proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will consist of underlying funds that primarily invest in bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in lower rated debt instruments \\u2014 Lower rated bonds and other lower rated debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuer\\u2019s creditworthiness than those of higher quality debt securities. The market prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of higher quality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. These risks may be increased with respect to investments in junk bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in small companies \\u2014 Investing in smaller companies may pose additional risks. For example, it is often more difficult to value or dispose of small company stocks and more difficult to obtain information about smaller companies than about larger companies. Furthermore, smaller companies often have limited product lines, operating histories, markets and/or financial resources, may be dependent on one or a few key persons for management, and can be more susceptible to losses. Moreover, the prices of their stocks may be more volatile than stocks of larger, more established companies, particularly during times of market turmoil.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as nationalization, currency blockage or the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, each of which could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by an underlying fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\n25     American Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in emerging markets \\u2014 Investing in emerging markets may involve risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in the securities markets of developed countries. For instance, emerging market countries may have less developed legal and accounting systems than those in developed countries. The governments of these countries may be less stable and more likely to impose capital controls, nationalize a company or industry, place restrictions on foreign ownership and on withdrawing sale proceeds of securities from the country, and/or impose punitive taxes that could adversely affect the prices of securities. In addition, the economies of these countries may be dependent on relatively few industries that are more susceptible to local and global changes. Securities markets in these countries can also be relatively small and have substantially lower trading volumes. As a result, securities issued in these countries may be more volatile and less liquid, and may be more difficult to value, than securities issued in countries with more developed economies and/or markets. Less certainty with respect to security valuations may lead to additional challenges and risks in calculating the underlying fund\\u2019s net asset value. Additionally, emerging markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades and the holding of securities by banks, agents and depositories that are less established than those in developed countries.\\n\\nInvesting in derivatives \\u2014 The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and a derivative instrument may expose the underlying fund to losses in excess of its initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult to value, difficult for the underlying fund to buy or sell at an opportune time or price and difficult to terminate or otherwise offset. The underlying fund\\u2019s use of derivatives may result in losses to the underlying fund, and investing in derivatives may reduce the underlying fund\\u2019s returns and increase the underlying fund\\u2019s price volatility. The underlying fund\\u2019s counterparty to a derivative transaction (including, if applicable, the underlying fund\\u2019s clearing broker, the derivatives exchange or the clearinghouse) may be unable or unwilling to honor its financial obligations in respect of the transaction.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund and to the underlying funds actively manages each underlying fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the underlying funds are subject to the risk that the methods and analyses, including models, tools and data, employed by the investment adviser in this process may be flawed or incorrect and may not produce the desired results. This could cause an underlying fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nNormally investing at least 80% of assets in common stocks included in the Fidelity U.S. Extended Investable Market Index\\u2120, which is a float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index designed to reflect the performance of U.S. mid- and small-cap stocks. Mid- and small-cap stocks are considered to be stocks of the top 2,500 U.S. companies, excluding the largest 500 companies, based on float-adjusted market capitalization.\\nUsing statistical sampling techniques based on such factors as capitalization, industry exposures, dividend yield, price/earnings (P/E) ratio, price/book (P/B) ratio, and earnings growth to attempt to replicate the returns of the Fidelity U.S. Extended Investable Market Index\\u2120 using a smaller number of securities.\\nLending securities to earn income for the fund.\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nStock Market Volatility.  Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Different parts of the market, including different market sectors, and different types of securities can react differently to these developments.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. Changes in the financial condition of an issuer or counterparty (e.g., broker-dealer or other borrower in a securities lending transaction) can increase the risk of default by an issuer or counterparty, which can affect a security's or instrument's value or result in delays in recovering securities and/or capital from a counterparty.\\nCorrelation to Index.  The performance of the fund and its index may vary somewhat due to factors such as fees and expenses of the fund, transaction costs, sample selection, regulatory restrictions, and timing differences associated with additions to and deletions from its index.\\nPassive Management Risk.  The fund is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of the fund\\u2019s index or of the actual securities included in the index. This differs from an actively managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the fund\\u2019s performance could be lower than actively managed funds that may shift their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers.\\nMid Cap Investing.  The value of securities of medium size, less well-known issuers can perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of stocks and can be more volatile than that of larger issuers.\\nSmall Cap Investing.  The value of securities of smaller, less well-known issuers can perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of stocks and can be more volatile than that of larger issuers.\\nSecurities Lending Risk.  Securities lending involves the risk that the borrower may fail to return the securities loaned in a timely manner or at all. If the borrower defaults on its obligation to return the securities loaned because of insolvency or other reasons, a fund could experience delays and costs in recovering the securities loaned or in gaining access to the collateral.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.

These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing your intermediary and your investment professional to recommend the fund over another investment.

Ask your investment professional or visit your intermediary's web site for more information.\",\n          \"American Funds College 2024 Fund\\n\\nInvestment objectives The fund will seek to achieve the following objectives to varying degrees: growth, income and preservation of capital, depending on the proximity to its target date. The target date is meant to roughly correspond to the year in which the fund beneficiary will start to withdraw funds to meet higher education expenses. The fund will increasingly emphasize income and preservation of capital by investing a greater portion of its assets in bond, equity-income and balanced funds as it approaches and passes its target date. In this way, the fund seeks to achieve an appropriate balance of total return and stability during different time periods.\\n\\nFees and expenses of the fund This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. You may qualify for a Class 529-A sales charge discount if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $100,000 in American Funds. More information about these and other discounts is available from your financial professional, in the \\u201cSales charge reductions and waivers\\u201d sections on page 67 of the prospectus and on page 80 of the fund\\u2019s statement of additional information, and in the sales charge waiver appendix to this prospectus.\\n\\n \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\nShareholder fees (fees paid directly from your investment)\\nShare class:\\t529-A\\t529-C\\t529-E\\t529-T\\t529-F-1\\nMaximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a percentage of offering price)\\t4.25%\\tnone\\tnone\\t2.50%\\tnone\\nMaximum deferred sales charge (load) (as a percentage of the amount redeemed)\\t1.00*\\t1.00%\\tnone\\tnone\\tnone\\nMaximum sales charge (load) imposed on reinvested dividends\\tnone\\tnone\\tnone\\tnone\\tnone\\nRedemption or exchange fees\\tnone\\tnone\\tnone\\tnone\\tnone\\n \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\nAnnual fund operating expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\nShare class:\\t529-A\\t529-C\\t529-E\\t529-T\\t529-F-1\\nManagement fees\\tnone\\tnone\\tnone\\tnone\\tnone\\nDistribution and/or service (12b-1) fees\\t0.23%\\t1.00%\\t0.50%\\t0.25%\\t0.00%\\nOther expenses\\t0.20\\t0.19\\t0.16\\t0.24\\t0.19\\nAcquired (underlying) fund fees and expenses\\t0.28\\t0.28\\t0.28\\t0.28\\t0.28\\nTotal annual fund operating expenses\\t0.71\\t1.47\\t0.94\\t0.77\\t0.47\\n* A contingent deferred sales charge of 1.00% applies on certain redemptions made within 18 months following purchases of $1 million or more made without an initial sales charge.

The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\nShare class:\\t529-A\\t529-C\\t529-E\\t529-T\\t529-F-1\\tFor the share class listed to the right, you would pay the following if you did not redeem your shares:\\tShare class:\\t529-C\\n1 year\\t$ 494\\t$ 250\\t$ 96\\t$ 327\\t$ 48\\t1 year\\t$ 150\\n3 years\\t642\\t465\\t300\\t490\\t151\\t3 years\\t465\\n5 years\\t803\\t803\\t520\\t667\\t263\\t5 years\\t803\\n10 years\\t1,270\\t1,757\\t1,155\\t1,180\\t591\\t10 years\\t1,757\\nPortfolio turnover The fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 6% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund will attempt to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a mix of American Funds in different combinations and weightings. The underlying American Funds represent a variety of fund categories such as growth funds, growth-and-income funds, equity-income funds, balanced funds and bond funds. The fund categories represent differing investment objectives. For example, growth funds seek long-term growth primarily through investing in both U.S. stocks and stocks of issuers domiciled outside the U.S. Growth-and-income funds seek long-term growth-and-income primarily through investments in stocks. Equity-income and balanced funds generally strive for income and growth through stocks and/or bond investments, while bond funds seek current income through bond investments. The fund is designed for investors who plan to attend college in, or close to, the year designated in the fund\\u2019s name.\\n\\nThe investment adviser may periodically rebalance or modify the asset mix of the funds and change the underlying fund investments. According to its current investment approach, the percentage of the fund invested in different categories will change until the fund reaches its target date. Upon reaching its target date, the fund will be principally invested in fixed-income funds and may merge into the Enrollment Fund, which will also be principally invested in fixed-income funds.\\n\\nThe fund\\u2019s investment adviser periodically reviews the investment strategies and asset mix of the underlying funds. The investment adviser will also consider whether overall market conditions would favor a change in the exposure of the fund to various asset types or geographic regions. Based on these considerations, the investment adviser may make adjustments to underlying fund holdings by adjusting the percentage of individual underlying funds within the fund, or adding or removing underlying funds. The investment adviser may also determine not to change the underlying fund allocations, particularly in response to short-term market movements, if in its opinion the combination of underlying funds is appropriate to meet the fund\\u2019s investment objective.\\n\\nWith respect to its fixed-income investments, the underlying funds in which the fund invests may hold debt securities with a wide range of quality and maturities. The fund may invest in underlying funds with significant exposure to bonds rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser, or unrated but determined by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser to be of equivalent quality. Securities rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below are sometimes referred to as \\u201cjunk bonds.\\u201d Exposure to lower rated securities may help the fund achieve its objective of providing current income.\\n\\nThe underlying funds may hold securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government, securities issued by federal agencies and instrumentalities and securities backed by mortgages or other assets. The underlying funds may also invest in the debt securities of governments, agencies, corporations and other entities domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\nAmerican Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus     30\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nThe following chart illustrates the investment approach of the fund by showing how its investment in the various fund categories will change over time. The allocations shown reflect the fund\\u2019s target allocations as of January 1, 2019.\\n\\nInvestment approach\\n\\n\\n\\nThe investment adviser anticipates that the fund will invest its assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below the investment approach set forth above. For example, a 20% target allocation to growth funds is not expected to be greater than 30% or less than 10%. The investment adviser will continuously monitor the fund and may make modifications to either the investment approach or the underlying fund allocations that the investment adviser believes could benefit shareholders.\\n\\nPrincipal risks This section describes the principal risks associated with investing in the fund and its underlying funds. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s investment strategies.\\n\\nAllocation risk \\u2014 Investments in the fund are subject to risks related to the investment adviser\\u2019s allocation choices. The selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund\\u2019s assets could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nFund structure \\u2014 The fund invests in underlying funds and incurs expenses related to the underlying funds. In addition, investors in the fund will incur fees to pay for certain expenses related to the operations of the fund. An investor holding the underlying funds directly and in the same proportions as the fund would incur lower overall expenses but would not receive the benefit of the portfolio management and other services provided by the fund.\\n\\nUnderlying fund risks \\u2014 Because the fund\\u2019s investments consist of underlying funds, the fund\\u2019s risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. For this reason, it is important to understand the risks associated with investing in the underlying funds, as described below.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the underlying funds\\u2019 investment strategies.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks, bonds and other securities held by the underlying funds may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental, governmental agency or central bank responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the underlying funds may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance, major litigation against the issuer, changes in government regulations affecting the issuer or its competitive environment and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\n31     American Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in stocks \\u2014 Investing in stocks may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments. As a result, the value of the underlying funds may be subject to sharp, short-term declines in value. Income provided by an underlying fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available at, the companies in which the underlying fund invests. As the fund nears its target date, a decreasing proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will be invested in underlying funds that invest primarily in stocks. Accordingly, these risks are expected to be more significant the further the fund is removed from its target date and are expected to lessen as the fund approaches its target date.\\n\\nInvesting in debt instruments \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, bonds and other debt securities held by an underlying fund may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the effective maturities and credit ratings of these securities.\\n\\nRising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. A general rise in interest rates may cause investors to sell debt securities on a large scale, which could also adversely affect the price and liquidity of debt securities and could also result in increased redemptions from the fund. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund failing to recoup the full amount of its initial investment and having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities generally have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter maturity debt securities.\\n\\nBonds and other debt securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer or guarantor will weaken or be perceived to be weaker, and/or an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default. A downgrade or default affecting any of the underlying funds\\u2019 securities could cause the value of the underlying funds\\u2019 shares to decrease. Credit risk is gauged, in part, by the credit ratings of the debt securities in which the underlying fund invests. However, ratings are only the opinions of the rating agencies issuing them and are not guarantees as to credit quality or an evaluation of market risk. The underlying funds\\u2019 investment adviser relies on its own credit analysts to research issuers and issues in seeking to assess credit and default risks. These risks will be more significant as the fund approaches its target date because a greater proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will consist of underlying funds that primarily invest in bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in lower rated debt instruments \\u2014 Lower rated bonds and other lower rated debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuer\\u2019s creditworthiness than those of higher quality debt securities. The market prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of higher quality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. These risks may be increased with respect to investments in junk bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in small companies \\u2014 Investing in smaller companies may pose additional risks. For example, it is often more difficult to value or dispose of small company stocks and more difficult to obtain information about smaller companies than about larger companies. Furthermore, smaller companies often have limited product lines, operating histories, markets and/or financial resources, may be dependent on one or a few key persons for management, and can be more susceptible to losses. Moreover, the prices of their stocks may be more volatile than stocks of larger, more established companies, particularly during times of market turmoil.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as nationalization, currency blockage or the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, each of which could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by an underlying fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\nInvesting in emerging markets \\u2014 Investing in emerging markets may involve risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in the securities markets of developed countries. For instance, emerging market countries may have less developed legal and accounting systems than those in developed countries. The governments of these countries may be less stable and more likely to impose capital controls, nationalize a company or industry, place restrictions on foreign ownership and on withdrawing sale proceeds of securities from the country, and/or impose punitive taxes that could adversely affect the prices of securities. In addition, the economies of these countries may be dependent on relatively few industries that are more susceptible to local and global changes. Securities markets in these countries can also be relatively small and have substantially lower trading volumes. As a result, securities issued in these countries may be more volatile and less liquid, and may be more difficult to value, than securities issued in countries with more developed economies and/or markets. Less certainty with respect to security valuations may lead to additional challenges and risks in calculating the underlying fund\\u2019s net asset value. Additionally, emerging markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades and the holding of securities by banks, agents and depositories that are less established than those in developed countries.\\n\\nAmerican Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus     32\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities \\u2014 Mortgage-related securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities, include debt obligations that represent interests in pools of mortgages or other income-bearing assets, such as consumer loans or receivables. Such securities often involve risks that are different from or more acute than the risks associated with investing in other types of debt securities. Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are subject to changes in the payment patterns of borrowers of the underlying debt, potentially increasing the volatility of the securities and an underlying fund\\u2019s net asset value. When interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to refinance or prepay their debt before its stated maturity. This may result in an underlying fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities, effectively reducing the underlying fund\\u2019s income. Conversely, if interest rates rise and borrowers repay their debt more slowly than expected, the time in which the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are paid off could be extended, reducing an underlying fund\\u2019s cash available for reinvestment in higher yielding securities. Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to the risk that underlying borrowers will be unable to meet their obligations and the value of property that secures the mortgages may decline in value and be insufficient, upon foreclosure, to repay the associated loans. Investments in asset-backed securities are subject to similar risks.\\n\\nInvesting in securities backed by the U.S. government \\u2014 Securities backed by the U.S. Treasury or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are guaranteed only as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity. Accordingly, the current market values for these securities will fluctuate with changes in interest rates and the credit rating of the U.S. government. Securities issued by government-sponsored entities and federal agencies and instrumentalities that are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. government.\\n\\nInvesting in derivatives \\u2014 The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and a derivative instrument may expose the underlying fund to losses in excess of its initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult to value, difficult for the underlying fund to buy or sell at an opportune time or price and difficult to terminate or otherwise offset. The underlying fund\\u2019s use of derivatives may result in losses to the underlying fund, and investing in derivatives may reduce the underlying fund\\u2019s returns and increase the underlying fund\\u2019s price volatility. The underlying fund\\u2019s counterparty to a derivative transaction (including, if applicable, the underlying fund\\u2019s clearing broker, the derivatives exchange or the clearinghouse) may be unable or unwilling to honor its financial obligations in respect of the transaction.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund and to the underlying funds actively manages each underlying fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the underlying funds are subject to the risk that the methods and analyses, including models, tools and data, employed by the investment adviser in this process may be flawed or incorrect and may not produce the desired results. This could cause an underlying fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person.

Thereafter, the fund\\u2019s objective will be to seek high current income and, as a secondary objective, capital appreciation.\\n\\nFee Table\\n\\nThe following table describes the fees and expenses that may be incurred when you buy and hold shares of the fund.\\n\\nShareholder fees\\n\\n(fees paid directly from your investment) \\tNone \\nAnnual Operating Expenses\\n\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a % of the value of your investment)\\n\\nManagement fee(a) \\t \\t0.57% \\nDistribution and/or Service (12b-1) fees \\t \\tNone \\nOther expenses(a) \\t \\t0.00% \\nTotal annual operating expenses(a) \\t \\t0.57% \\n(a)   Adjusted to reflect current fees.\\n\\nThis example helps compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other funds. The example assumes that you are not participating in the Fidelity\\u00ae systematic withdrawal plan.\\n\\nLet's say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that your shareholder fees and the annual operating expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated:\\n\\n1 year \\t$58 \\n3 years \\t$179 \\n5 years \\t$307 \\n10 years \\t$659 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe fund will not incur transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells shares of underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio), but it could incur transaction costs if it were to buy and sell other types of securities directly. If the fund were to buy and sell other types of securities directly, a higher portfolio turnover rate could indicate higher transaction costs and could result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. Such costs, if incurred, would not be reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example and would affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 20% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nInvesting primarily in a combination of Fidelity\\u00ae domestic equity funds, international equity funds, bond funds, and short-term funds (underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds) to seek to achieve the fund's investment objective consistent with a payment strategy to be administered through a complementary systematic withdrawal plan.\\nAllocating assets according to a neutral asset allocation strategy shown in the glide path below that adjusts over time until it reaches an allocation similar to that of the Fidelity Managed Retirement Income Fund\\u2120, approximately 10 to 20 years after the year 2015. FMR Co., Inc. (the Adviser) may modify the fund\\u2019s neutral asset allocations from time to time when in the interests of shareholders.\\nBuying and selling futures contracts (both long and short positions) in an effort to manage cash flows efficiently, remain fully invested, or facilitate asset allocation.\\nThe Adviser may continue to seek total return for several years beyond the fund's horizon date in an effort to achieve the fund's overall investment objective.\\n\\nAs of July 31, 2018, the fund's neutral asset allocation to underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds and futures was approximately:\\n   \\tDomestic Equity Funds* \\t27% \\n   \\tInternational Equity Funds* \\t12% \\n   \\tBond Funds* \\t46% \\n   \\tShort-Term Funds* \\t15% \\n\\n* The Adviser may change these percentages over time. As a result of the active asset allocation strategy (discussed below), actual allocations may differ from the neutral allocations above. The allocation percentages may not add to 100% due to rounding.\\n\\nThe Adviser may use an active asset allocation strategy to increase or decrease neutral asset class exposures reflected above by up to 10% for equity funds, bond funds and short-term funds to reflect the Adviser's market outlook, which is primarily focused on the intermediate term. The asset allocations in the glide path and pie chart above are referred to as neutral because they do not reflect any decisions made by the Adviser to overweight or underweight an asset class.\\nDesigned for investors age 60 and above who turned age 70 in or within a few years of 2015 (horizon date) and plan to gradually withdraw the value of their account in the fund over time.\\nThe fund's investment objective is intended to support a payment strategy designed to be implemented through a shareholder's voluntary participation in a complementary systematic withdrawal plan that will enable shareholders to receive regular payments from the fund. However, shareholders may invest in the fund and not participate in the plan.\\n\\nInvestors should refer to the \\\"Features and Policies\\\" section of the prospectus for a summary of how the payment strategy and plan are designed to operate.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nThe fund is designed for investors who seek to convert accumulated assets into regular payments over time. A shareholder's participation in the systematic withdrawal plan will result in the gradual withdrawal of the value of the shareholder's account in the fund. The fund's share price fluctuates, which means you could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nAsset Allocation Risk.  The fund is subject to risks resulting from the Adviser's asset allocation decisions. If FMRC's asset allocation strategy does not work as intended, the fund may not achieve its objective. If the fund is unable to achieve its objective, the payment strategy may not work as intended. The selection of underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among various asset classes could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives. In addition, the fund's active asset allocation strategy may cause the fund to have a risk profile different than that portrayed above from time to time and may increase losses.\\nInvesting in Other Funds.  The fund bears all risks of investment strategies employed by the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives.\\nStock Market Volatility.  Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Different parts of the market, including different market sectors, and different types of securities can react differently to these developments.\\nInterest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt or money market security to decrease.\\nForeign Exposure.  Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, can be more volatile than the U.S. market due to increased risks of adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can perform differently from the U.S. market. Emerging markets can be subject to greater social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties and can be extremely volatile. Foreign exchange rates also can be extremely volatile.\\nIndustry Exposure.  Market conditions, interest rates, and economic, regulatory, or financial developments could significantly affect a single industry or group of related industries.\\nPrepayment.  The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security's maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest rates change.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease. Lower-quality debt securities (those of less than investment-grade quality, also referred to as high yield debt securities or junk bonds) and certain types of other securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality of the issuer. The value of lower-quality debt securities and certain types of other securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.\\nCorrelation to Index.  The performance of an underlying index fund and its index may vary somewhat due to factors such as fees and expenses of the underlying fund, transaction costs, sample selection, regulatory restrictions, and timing differences associated with additions to and deletions from the index.\\nPassive Management Risk.  An underlying fund is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of an underlying fund's index or of the actual securities included in the index. This differs from an actively managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, an underlying fund's performance could be lower than actively managed funds that may shift their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers.\\nLeverage Risk.  Leverage can increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly.\\n\\\"Value\\\" Investing.  \\\"Value\\\" stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.\\nCommodity-Linked Investing.  The value of commodities and commodity-linked investments may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as weather, political, tax, and other regulatory and market developments. Commodity-linked investments may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying commodity, instruments, or measures.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund. The information illustrates the changes in the performance of the fund's shares from year to year and compares the performance of the fund's shares to the performance of a securities market index and an additional index over various periods of time. The indexes have characteristics relevant to the fund's investment strategies. Index descriptions appear in the \\\"Additional Index Information\\\" section of the prospectus.

The operating expenses in this fee table will not correlate to the expense ratio in the Fund\\u2019s financial highlights because the financial statements include only the direct operating expenses incurred by the Fund.\\n \\n\\nExample: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based upon these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\n\\nClass\\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nA\\t$696\\t$1,004\\t$1,333\\t$2,263\\nC\\t$230\\t$709\\t$1,215\\t$2,605\\nI\\t$129\\t$403\\t$697\\t$1,534\\n \\n\\nPortfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 9% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\n \\n\\n1 \\n \\n \\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies: Using the sub-adviser\\u2019s proprietary \\u201cDefined Risk Strategy\\u201d (\\u201cDRS\\u201d) to select the Fund\\u2019s investments, the Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing directly, or indirectly through exchange-traded funds (\\u201cETFs\\u201d), in:\\n\\n\\u00b7\\tequity securities that are represented in the S&P 500 Index,\\n\\u00b7\\texchange-traded long-term put options on the S&P 500 Index for hedging purposes, and\\n\\u00b7\\tbuying and selling exchange-traded put and call options on various equity indices to generate additional returns.\\n \\n\\nThe DRS seeks to provide risk-managed growth of capital by matching or exceeding the long-term performance of the stock market while avoiding the traditional losses incurred during bear markets. The Fund invests primarily in equity securities of large capitalization (over $10 billion) US companies directly or through ETFs. The Fund may also have small investments in equity securities of smaller and foreign companies through sector-based or S&P 500 Index ETFs. The sub-adviser anticipates income from dividend payments made by ETFs and individual securities, as well as income from short term trades and option premiums, although option income is also described as capital appreciation for tax and accounting purposes. The sub-adviser anticipates executing ETF trades through an exchange rather than trading directly with a fund.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe DRS philosophy is based upon the sub-adviser\\u2019s research indicating that market timing and/or stock selection is extremely difficult, may produce volatile returns and that asset allocation is limited in its risk reduction. Using DRS, the sub-adviser seeks to \\u201cdefine risk\\u201d by seeking to protect against large losses by hedging equity ETFs through investments in protective long-term S&P 500 Index put options. Additionally, the sub-adviser seeks to increase returns by buying and selling call and put options on several indices using hedging strategies.\\n\\n \\n\\nDefined Risk Strategy\\n\\n \\n\\nThe DRS was created in 1997 by Randy Swan, President of the sub-adviser. The objective of the DRS is to provide risk-managed growth of capital by offering a strategy that seeks to match or exceed the long-term performance of the stock market without the traditional losses incurred during bear markets. The DRS philosophy is based upon the sub-adviser\\u2019s research indicating that market timing and/or stock selection is extremely difficult and that asset allocation is limited in its risk reduction properties.\\n\\n \\n\\nHedging Process\\n\\n \\n\\nThe sub-adviser applies a protective put hedging strategy to hedge the Fund\\u2019s equity exposure. The Fund invests in long-term put options (referred to as paying a premium) that gives the Fund the right to sell a security or index at a set (strike) price or sell the long-term put option on an option exchange. The protective put strategy is executed using exchange-traded S&P 500 Index put options to hedge the portfolio and to reduce volatility. The protective put strategy seeks to limit downside loss. Generally, S&P 500 Index put options have an inverse relationship to the S&P 500 Index and its sector-specific constituents.\\n\\n \\n\\nOption Writing\\n\\n \\n\\nTo generate additional returns, the sub-adviser buys and sells short-term (generally 1-3 month) (i) put and call options on equity indices, such as the S&P 500, Sector SDPR and Russell 2000, (ii) ETFs and (iii) futures on a regular basis. Additionally, the sub-adviser will regularly engage in various spread option strategies. Spread option strategies involve, for example, selling a 1-month call option while buying a 2-month call option. Each option strategy includes a hedging element so that the Fund is not exposed to significant losses on written options.\\n\\n \\n\\nRebalancing\\n\\n \\n\\nThe sub-adviser may rebalance the ETF portfolio to maintain approximately equal weighting across the sectors of the S&P 500 to avoid excessive exposure to one economic sector. Long-term protective put options are typically traded annually to protect capital and/or allow for profit potential, by re-establishing a current-market strike price which depends on whether or not the market has increased or decreased.\\n\\n \\n\\nAs discussed further below, the sub-adviser intends on having very little portfolio turnover since most of the ETF portfolio will be held indefinitely. Written options are bought back when the sub-adviser believes they present an unfavorable risk and reward profile. Purchased options are sold when the sub-adviser believes they present an unfavorable risk and reward profile or when more attractive investments are available.\\n2 \\n \\nPrincipal Investment Risks: As with all mutual funds, there is the risk that you could lose money through your investment in the Fund. The Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program. Many factors affect the Fund\\u2019s net asset value (\\u201cNAV\\u201d) and performance. The following risks may apply to the Fund\\u2019s direct investments as well as the Fund\\u2019s indirect risks through investing in ETFs.\\n\\nETF Risk: ETFs are subject to investment advisory and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. As a result, the cost of investing in the Fund will be higher than the cost of investing directly in ETFs and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in stocks. ETFs are subject to specific risks, depending on the nature of the fund.\\nLeveraging Risk: The use of leverage, such as that embedded in options, could magnify the Fund\\u2019s gains or losses.\\nManagement Risk: The sub-adviser\\u2019s dependence on its DRS process and judgments about the attractiveness, value and potential appreciation of particular investments or ETFs and options in which the Fund invests or writes may prove to be incorrect and may not produce the desired results.\\nMarket Risk: Overall securities market risks will affect the value of individual instruments in which the Fund invests. Factors such as economic growth and market conditions, interest rate levels, and political events affect the US securities markets. When the value of the Fund\\u2019s investments goes down, your investment in the Fund decreases in value and you could lose money.\\nOption Risk: Purchased put options may expire worthless and may have imperfect correlation to the value of the Fund\\u2019s sector based investments. Written call and put options may limit the Fund\\u2019s participation in equity market gains and may amplify losses in market declines. The Fund\\u2019s losses are potentially large in a written put or call transaction. If unhedged, written calls expose the Fund to potentially unlimited losses.\\n \\n\\nPerformance: The bar chart and performance table below show the variability of the Fund\\u2019s returns over time, which is some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows performance of the Fund\\u2019s Class I shares for each full calendar year since the Fund\\u2019s inception. You should be aware that the Fund\\u2019s past performance (before and after taxes) may not be an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Although Class A and Class C shares would have similar annual returns to Class I shares because the classes are invested in the same portfolio of securities, the returns for Class A and Class C shares would be different from Class I shares because Class A and Class C shares have different expenses than Class I shares.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 4% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund will attempt to achieve its investment objective by investing in a mix of American Funds bond funds. The fund will principally invest in funds that seek current income through bond investments. The fund is designed for investors who attend college currently or plan to in the near future.\\n\\nWhen determining in which bond funds to invest, the investment adviser will predominately seek exposure to higher quality bonds (rated A- or better or A3 or better by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser, or unrated but determined by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser to be of equivalent quality) with intermediate to short-term durations. The fund may, however, invest in underlying funds with exposure to lower quality, higher yielding securities rated BBB+ or below and Baa1 or below (including those rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below) or unrated but determined by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser to be of equivalent quality, and to bonds with longer durations.\\n\\nThe underlying funds may hold securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government, securities issued by federal agencies and instrumentalities and securities backed by mortgages or other assets. The investment adviser anticipates that exposure to mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities may help the fund generate current income. The underlying funds may also invest in the debt securities of governments, agencies, corporations and other entities domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\nThe fund\\u2019s investment adviser seeks to create a combination of underlying funds that complement each other with a goal of achieving the fund\\u2019s investment objective of providing current income, consistent with preservation of capital. In making this determination, the fund\\u2019s investment adviser considers the historical volatility and returns of the underlying funds and how various combinations would have behaved in past market environments. It also considers, among other topics, current market conditions and the investment positions of the underlying funds.\\n\\nPrincipal risks This section describes the principal risks associated with investing in the fund and its underlying funds. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s investment strategies.\\n\\nAllocation risk \\u2014 Investments in the fund are subject to risks related to the investment adviser\\u2019s allocation choices. The selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund\\u2019s assets could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nFund structure \\u2014 The fund invests in underlying funds and incurs expenses related to the underlying funds. In addition, investors in the fund will incur fees to pay for certain expenses related to the operations of the fund. An investor holding the underlying funds directly and in the same proportions as the fund would incur lower overall expenses but would not receive the benefit of the portfolio management and other services provided by the fund.\\n\\nUnderlying fund risks \\u2014 Because the fund\\u2019s investments consist of underlying funds, the fund\\u2019s risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. For this reason, it is important to understand the risks associated with investing in the underlying funds, as described below.\\n\\nAmerican Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus     44\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the underlying funds\\u2019 investment strategies.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks, bonds and other securities held by the underlying funds may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental, governmental agency or central bank responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the underlying funds may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance, major litigation against the issuer, changes in government regulations affecting the issuer or its competitive environment and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nInvesting in debt instruments \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, bonds and other debt securities held by an underlying fund may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the effective maturities and credit ratings of these securities.\\n\\nRising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. A general rise in interest rates may cause investors to sell debt securities on a large scale, which could also adversely affect the price and liquidity of debt securities and could also result in increased redemptions from the fund. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund failing to recoup the full amount of its initial investment and having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities generally have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter maturity debt securities.\\n\\nBonds and other debt securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer or guarantor will weaken or be perceived to be weaker, and/or an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default. A downgrade or default affecting any of the underlying funds\\u2019 securities could cause the value of the underlying funds\\u2019 shares to decrease. Credit risk is gauged, in part, by the credit ratings of the debt securities in which the underlying fund invests. However, ratings are only the opinions of the rating agencies issuing them and are not guarantees as to credit quality or an evaluation of market risk. The underlying funds\\u2019 investment adviser relies on its own credit analysts to research issuers and issues in seeking to assess credit and default risks. These risks will be more significant as the fund approaches its target date because a greater proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will consist of underlying funds that primarily invest in bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in lower rated debt instruments \\u2014 Lower rated bonds and other lower rated debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuer\\u2019s creditworthiness than those of higher quality debt securities. The market prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of higher quality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. These risks may be increased with respect to investments in lower quality, higher yielding debt securities rated Ba1 or below and BB+ or below by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser or unrated but determined by the investment adviser to be of equivalent quality, which securities are sometimes referred to as \\u201cjunk bonds.\\u201d\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as nationalization, currency blockage or the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, each of which could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by an underlying fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\nInvesting in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities \\u2014 Mortgage-related securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities, include debt obligations that represent interests in pools of mortgages or other income-bearing assets, such as consumer loans or receivables. Such securities often involve risks that are different from or more acute than the risks associated with investing in other types of debt securities. Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are subject to changes in the payment patterns of borrowers of the underlying debt, potentially increasing the volatility of the securities and an underlying fund\\u2019s net asset value. When interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to refinance or prepay their debt before its stated maturity. This may result in an underlying fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities, effectively reducing the underlying fund\\u2019s income. Conversely, if interest rates rise and borrowers repay their debt more slowly than expected, the time in which the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are paid off could be extended, reducing an underlying fund\\u2019s cash available for reinvestment in higher yielding securities. Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to the risk that underlying borrowers will be unable to meet their obligations and the value of property that secures the mortgages may decline in value and be insufficient, upon foreclosure, to repay the associated loans. Investments in asset-backed securities are subject to similar risks.\\n\\nInvesting in securities backed by the U.S. government \\u2014 Securities backed by the U.S. Treasury or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are guaranteed only as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity. Accordingly, the current market values for these securities will fluctuate with changes in interest rates and the credit rating of the U.S. government. Securities issued by\\n\\n45     American Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\ngovernment-sponsored entities and federal agencies and instrumentalities that are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. government.\\n\\nInvesting in future delivery contracts \\u2014 An underlying fund may enter into contracts, such as to-be-announced contracts and mortgage dollar rolls, that involve an underlying fund selling mortgage-related securities and simultaneously contracting to repurchase similar securities for delivery at a future date at a predetermined price. This can increase the underlying fund\\u2019s market exposure, and the market price of the securities that the underlying fund contracts to repurchase could drop below their purchase price. While an underlying fund can preserve and generate capital through the use of such contracts by, for example, realizing the difference between the sale price and the future purchase price, the income generated by the underlying fund may be reduced by engaging in such transactions. In addition, these transactions may increase the turnover rate of the underlying fund.\\n\\nInvesting in derivatives \\u2014 The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and a derivative instrument may expose the underlying fund to losses in excess of its initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult to value, difficult for the underlying fund to buy or sell at an opportune time or price and difficult to terminate or otherwise offset. The underlying fund\\u2019s use of derivatives may result in losses to the underlying fund, and investing in derivatives may reduce the underlying fund\\u2019s returns and increase the underlying fund\\u2019s price volatility. The underlying fund\\u2019s counterparty to a derivative transaction (including, if applicable, the underlying fund\\u2019s clearing broker, the derivatives exchange or the clearinghouse) may be unable or unwilling to honor its financial obligations in respect of the transaction.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund and to the underlying funds actively manages each underlying fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the underlying funds are subject to the risk that the methods and analyses, including models, tools and data, employed by the investment adviser in this process may be flawed or incorrect and may not produce the desired results. This could cause an underlying fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person.

The front-end sales charge applicable to Class T shares is a per-transaction charge, meaning that separate orders will not be aggregated for purposes of calculating the rate of the sales charge payable. An investor transacting in a class of Fund shares without any front-end sales charge, contingent deferred sales charge, or other asset-based fee for sales or distribution may be required to pay a commission to the financial intermediary for effecting such transactions. Such commission rates are set by the financial intermediary and are not reflected in the tables or the example below. You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and members of your immediate family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in certain classes of shares of eligible funds distributed by Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. (the Distributor). More information is available about these and other sales charge discounts and waivers from your financial intermediary, and can be found in the Choosing a Share Class section beginning on page 21 of the Fund\\u2019s prospectus, in Appendix A to the prospectus beginning on page A-1 and in Appendix S to the Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under Sales Charge Waivers beginning on page S-1.\\n    \\nShareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment)\\n \\tClass A\\tClass C\\tClass T\\tClasses Adv,\\nInst, Inst2,\\nInst3 and R\\nMaximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a % of offering price)\\t5.75%\\tNone\\t2.50%\\tNone\\nMaximum deferred sales charge (load) imposed on redemptions (as a % of the lower of the original purchase price or current net asset value)\\t1.00% (a)\\t1.00% (b)\\tNone\\tNone\\n    \\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\n \\tClass A\\tClass Adv\\tClass C\\tClass Inst\\tClass Inst2\\tClass Inst3\\tClass R\\tClass T\\nManagement fees\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\nDistribution and/or service (12b-1) fees\\t0.25%\\t0.00%\\t1.00%\\t0.00%\\t0.00%\\t0.00%\\t0.50%\\t0.25%\\nOther expenses(c)\\t0.11%\\t0.11%\\t0.11%\\t0.11%\\t0.07%\\t0.02%\\t0.11%\\t0.11%\\nTotal annual Fund operating expenses\\t1.23%\\t0.98%\\t1.98%\\t0.98%\\t0.94%\\t0.89%\\t1.48%\\t1.23%\\n(a)\\tThis charge is imposed on certain investments of between $1 million and $50 million redeemed within 18 months after purchase, as follows: 1.00% if redeemed within 12 months after purchase, and 0.50% if redeemed more than 12, but less than 18, months after purchase, with certain limited exceptions.\\n(b)\\tThis charge applies to redemptions within 12 months after purchase, with certain limited exceptions.\\n(c)\\tOther expenses have been restated to reflect current transfer agency fees paid by the Fund.\\nExample\\nThe following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 39% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of companies operating in the communications, information and related industries. Accordingly, the Fund invests in companies operating in the information technology and telecommunications sectors as well as those in the media industry. In addition, as noted above, the Fund may invest in related industries, which provides the Fund with broad investment flexibility to invest in any industry and many of the issuers in which the Fund invests are technology and technology-related companies. These technology and technology-related companies may include companies operating in any industry, including but not limited to software, hardware, health care, medical technology and technology services, such as the internet.\\nThe Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign investments.\\nThe Fund may invest in securities of large capitalization companies that are well established and can be expected to grow with the market. The Fund may also invest in small-to-medium size capitalization companies that the Fund\\u2019s portfolio managers believe provide opportunities to benefit from the rapidly changing technologies and the expansion of the communications, information and related industries. These securities generally include common stocks.\\nThe Fund is non-diversified, which means that it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of fewer issuers than can a diversified fund.\\nPrincipal Risks\\nAn investment in the Fund involves risks, including those described below. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective and you may lose money. The value of the Fund\\u2019s holdings may decline, and the Fund\\u2019s net asset value (NAV) and share price may go down. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nActive Management Risk. Due to its active management, the Fund could underperform its benchmark index and/or other funds with similar investment objectives and/or strategies.\\nForeign Securities Risk. Investments in or exposure to foreign securities involve certain risks not associated with investments in or exposure to securities of U.S. companies. Foreign securities subject the Fund to the risks associated with investing in the particular country of an issuer, including political, regulatory, economic, social, diplomatic and other conditions or events (including, for example, military confrontations, war and terrorism),\\n4\\tPROSPECTUS 2018\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA SELIGMAN COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION FUND\\nSUMMARY OF THE FUND (continued)\\noccurring in the country or region, as well as risks associated with less developed custody and settlement practices. Foreign securities may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of U.S. companies, and are subject to the risks associated with potential imposition of economic and other sanctions against a particular foreign country, its nationals or industries or businesses within the country. In addition, foreign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on the Fund\\u2019s income, capital gains or proceeds from the disposition of foreign securities, which could reduce the Fund\\u2019s return on such securities. The performance of the Fund may also be negatively affected by fluctuations in a foreign currency's strength or weakness relative to the U.S. dollar, particularly to the extent the Fund invests a significant percentage of its assets in foreign securities or other assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\\nGrowth Securities Risk. Growth securities typically trade at a higher multiple of earnings than other types of equity securities. Accordingly, the market values of growth securities may never reach their expected market value and may decline in price. In addition, growth securities, at times, may not perform as well as value securities or the stock market in general, and may be out of favor with investors for varying periods of time.\\nIssuer Risk. An issuer in which the Fund invests or to which it has exposure may perform poorly, and the value of its securities may therefore decline, which would negatively affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, breakthroughs in technology, reliance on suppliers, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, natural disasters or other events, conditions or factors. The market capitalization of an issuer may also impact its risk profile. Investments in larger, more established companies may involve certain risks associated with their larger size. For instance, larger, more established companies may be less able to respond quickly to new competitive challenges, such as changes in consumer tastes or innovation from smaller competitors. Also, larger companies are sometimes less able to attain the high growth rates of successful smaller companies, especially during extended periods of economic expansion.\\nLiquidity Risk. Liquidity risk is the risk associated with any event, circumstance, or characteristic of an investment or market that negatively impacts the Fund\\u2019s ability to sell, or realize the proceeds from the sale of, an investment at a desirable time or price. Liquidity risk may arise because of, for example, a lack of marketability of the investment, which means that when seeking to sell its portfolio investments, the Fund could find that selling is more difficult than anticipated, especially during times of high market volatility. Market participants attempting to sell the same or a similar instrument at the same time as the Fund could exacerbate the Fund\\u2019s exposure to liquidity risk. The Fund may have to accept a lower selling price for the holding, sell other liquid or more liquid investments that it might otherwise prefer to hold (thereby increasing the proportion of the Fund\\u2019s investments in less liquid or illiquid securities), or forego another more appealing investment opportunity. Certain investments that were liquid when purchased by the Fund may later become illiquid, particularly in times of overall economic distress. Changing regulatory, market or other conditions or environments (for example, the interest rate or credit environments) may also adversely affect the liquidity and the price of the Fund's investments. Judgment plays a larger role in valuing illiquid or less liquid investments as compared to valuing liquid or more liquid investments. Price volatility may be higher for illiquid or less liquid investments as a result of, for example, the relatively less frequent pricing of such securities (as compared to liquid or more liquid investments). Generally, the less liquid the market at the time the Fund sells a portfolio investment, the greater the risk of loss or decline of value to the Fund. Overall market liquidity and other factors can lead to an increase in redemptions, which may negatively impact Fund performance and NAV, including, for example, if the Fund is forced to sell investments in a down market. Foreign securities can present enhanced liquidity risks, including as a result of less developed custody, settlement or other practices of foreign markets.\\nMarket Risk. Market risk refers to the possibility that the market values of securities or other investments that the Fund holds will fall, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, or fail to rise. An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods.\\nNon-Diversified Fund Risk. The Fund is non-diversified, which generally means that it will invest a greater percentage of its total assets in the securities of fewer issuers than a \\u201cdiversified\\u201d fund. This increases the risk that a change in the value of any one investment held by the Fund could affect the overall value of the Fund more than it would affect that of a diversified fund holding a greater number of investments. Accordingly, the Fund's value will likely be more volatile than the value of a more diversified fund.\\nPROSPECTUS 2018\\t5\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA SELIGMAN COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION FUND\\nSUMMARY OF THE FUND (continued)\\nSector Risk. At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business within one or more economic sectors, including the technology and technology-related sectors. Companies in the same sector may be similarly affected by economic, regulatory, political or market events or conditions, which may make the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that sector than funds that invest more broadly. Generally, the more broadly the Fund invests, the more it spreads risk and potentially reduces the risks of loss and volatility.\\nInformation Technology and Technology-Related Sectors. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the information technology sector, as well as other technology-related sectors (collectively, the technology sectors) than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the technology sectors are subject to certain risks, including the risk that new services, equipment or technologies will not be accepted by consumers and businesses or will become rapidly obsolete. Performance of such companies may be affected by factors including obtaining and protecting patents (or the failure to do so) and significant competitive pressures, including aggressive pricing of their products or services, new market entrants, competition for market share and short product cycles due to an accelerated rate of technological developments. Such competitive pressures may lead to limited earnings and/or falling profit margins. As a result, the value of their securities may fall or fail to rise. In addition, many technology sector companies have limited operating histories and prices of these companies\\u2019 securities historically have been more volatile than other securities, especially over the short term.\\nSmall- and Mid-Cap Company Securities Risk. Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies (small- and mid-cap companies) often involve greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies (larger companies) because small- and mid-cap companies tend to have less predictable earnings and may lack the management experience, financial resources, product diversification and competitive strengths of larger companies. Securities of small- and mid-cap companies may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of larger companies.\\nPerformance Information\\nThe following bar chart and table show you how the Fund has performed in the past, and can help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the Fund\\u2019s Class A share performance (without sales charges) has varied for each full calendar year shown. If the sales charges were reflected, returns shown would be lower. The table below the bar chart compares the Fund\\u2019s returns (after applicable sales charges shown in the Shareholder Fees table in this prospectus) for the periods shown with a broad measure of market performance.\\nThe performance of one or more share classes shown in the table below begins before the indicated inception date for such share class. The returns shown for each such share class include the returns of the Fund\\u2019s Class A shares (without applicable sales charges and adjusted to reflect the higher class-related operating expenses of such share classes, where applicable) for periods prior to its inception date. Share classes with expenses that are higher than Class A shares will have performance that is lower than Class A shares (without sales charges). Except for differences in annual returns resulting from differences in expenses and sales charges (where applicable), the share classes of the Fund would have substantially similar annual returns because all share classes of the Fund invest in the same portfolio of securities.\\nThe after-tax returns shown in the Average Annual Total Returns table below are calculated using the highest historical individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates in effect during the period indicated in the table and do not reflect the impact of state, local or foreign taxes. Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your personal tax situation and may differ from those shown in the table. In addition, the after-tax returns shown in the table do not apply to shares held in tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k) plans or Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). The after-tax returns are shown only for Class A shares and will vary for other share classes.\\nThe Fund\\u2019s past performance (before and after taxes) is no guarantee of how the Fund will perform in the future.

The example assumes that you are not participating in the Fidelity\\u00ae systematic withdrawal plan.\\n\\nLet's say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that your shareholder fees and the annual operating expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated:\\n\\n1 year \\t$48 \\n3 years \\t$149 \\n5 years \\t$260 \\n10 years \\t$585 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe fund will not incur transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells shares of underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio), but it could incur transaction costs if it were to buy and sell other types of securities directly. If the fund were to buy and sell other types of securities directly, a higher portfolio turnover rate could indicate higher transaction costs and could result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. Such costs, if incurred, would not be reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example and would affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 46% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nInvesting primarily in a combination of Fidelity\\u00ae domestic equity funds, international equity funds, bond funds, and short-term funds (underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds) to seek to achieve the fund's investment objective consistent with a payment strategy to be administered through a complementary systematic withdrawal plan.\\nAllocating assets according to a stable neutral asset allocation strategy shown in the glide path below. FMR Co., Inc. (the Adviser) may modify the fund\\u2019s neutral asset allocations from time to time when in the interests of shareholders.\\nBuying and selling futures contracts (both long and short positions) in an effort to manage cash flows efficiently, remain fully invested, or facilitate asset allocation.\\n\\nAllocating assets among underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds and futures according to a stable neutral asset allocation of approximately:\\n   \\tDomestic Equity Funds* \\t17% \\n   \\tInternational Equity Funds* \\t7% \\n   \\tBond Funds* \\t46% \\n   \\tShort-Term Funds* \\t30% \\n\\n* The Adviser may change these percentages over time. As a result of the active asset allocation strategy (discussed below), actual allocations may differ from the neutral allocations above.\\n\\nThe Adviser may use an active asset allocation strategy to increase or decrease neutral asset class exposures reflected above by up to 10% for equity funds, bond funds and short-term funds to reflect the Adviser's market outlook, which is primarily focused on the intermediate term. The asset allocations in the glide path and pie chart above are referred to as neutral because they do not reflect any decisions made by the Adviser to overweight or underweight an asset class.\\nThe fund's investment objective is intended to support a payment strategy designed to be implemented through a shareholder's voluntary participation in a complementary systematic withdrawal plan that will enable shareholders to receive regular payments from the fund based on their expected required minimum distributions from certain types of retirement accounts as mandated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). However, shareholders may invest in the fund and not participate in the plan.\\n\\nInvestors should refer to the \\\"Features and Policies\\\" section of the prospectus for a summary of how the payment strategy and plan are designed to operate.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nThe fund is designed for investors who seek to convert accumulated assets into regular payments over time. A shareholder's participation in the systematic withdrawal plan will result in the gradual withdrawal of the value of the shareholder's account in the fund. The fund's share price fluctuates, which means you could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nAsset Allocation Risk.  The fund is subject to risks resulting from the Adviser's asset allocation decisions. If FMRC's asset allocation strategy does not work as intended, the fund may not achieve its objective. If the fund is unable to achieve its objective, the payment strategy may not work as intended. The selection of underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among various asset classes could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives. In addition, the fund's active asset allocation strategy may cause the fund to have a risk profile different than that portrayed above from time to time and may increase losses.\\nInvesting in Other Funds.  The fund bears all risks of investment strategies employed by the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives.\\nStock Market Volatility.  Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Different parts of the market, including different market sectors, and different types of securities can react differently to these developments.\\nInterest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt or money market security to decrease.\\nForeign Exposure.  Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, can be more volatile than the U.S. market due to increased risks of adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can perform differently from the U.S. market.\\nIndustry Exposure.  Market conditions, interest rates, and economic, regulatory, or financial developments could significantly affect a single industry or group of related industries.\\nPrepayment.  The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security's maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest rates change.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease. Lower-quality debt securities (those of less than investment-grade quality, also referred to as high yield debt securities or junk bonds) and certain types of other securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality of the issuer. The value of lower-quality debt securities and certain types of other securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.\\nCorrelation to Index.  The performance of an underlying index fund and its index may vary somewhat due to factors such as fees and expenses of the underlying fund, transaction costs, sample selection, regulatory restrictions, and timing differences associated with additions to and deletions from the index.\\nPassive Management Risk.  An underlying fund is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of an underlying fund's index or of the actual securities included in the index. This differs from an actively managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, an underlying fund's performance could be lower than actively managed funds that may shift their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers.\\nLeverage Risk.  Leverage can increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly.\\nInflation-Protected Debt Exposure.  Increases in real interest rates can cause the price of inflation-protected debt securities to decrease. Interest payments on inflation-protected debt securities can be unpredictable.\\nCommodity-Linked Investing.  The value of commodities and commodity-linked investments may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as weather, political, tax, and other regulatory and market developments. Commodity-linked investments may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying commodity, instruments, or measures.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund.

Owners of variable insurance contracts that invest in the Shares should refer to the variable insurance contract prospectus for a description of fees and expenses, as the following table and examples do not reflect deductions at the separate account level or contract level for any charges that may be incurred under a contract. Inclusion of these charges would increase the fees and expenses described below.\\nANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\t \\t \\nManagement Fees\\t \\t0.64%\\nOther Expenses\\t \\t0.12%\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\t \\t0.76%\\n  \\nEXAMPLE:\\nThe Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Portfolio with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Portfolio for the time periods indicated, reinvest all dividends and distributions, and then redeem all of your Shares at the end of each period. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Portfolio\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n \\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nInstitutional Shares\\t$\\u200278\\t$\\u2002243\\t$\\u2002422\\t$\\u2002942\\n  \\nPortfolio Turnover:  The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Portfolio\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Portfolio\\u2019s turnover rate was 23% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES\\nThe Portfolio pursues its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of companies that the portfolio managers believe will benefit significantly from advances or improvements in technology. These companies generally fall into two categories:\\n\\u2022\\tcompanies that the portfolio managers believe have or will develop products, processes, or services that will provide significant technological advancements or improvements; and\\n\\u2022\\tcompanies that the portfolio managers believe rely extensively on technology in connection with their operations or services.\\nSome of the industries and companies likely to be represented in the Portfolio\\u2019s holdings include e-commerce (companies doing business through the Internet); computer (hardware and software); communications (voice, data, and wireless); industrials; Internet (software, services, and infrastructure equipment); and media and entertainment.\\nThe Portfolio implements this policy by investing primarily in equity securities of U.S. and foreign companies selected for their growth potential. The Portfolio typically invests at least 40% of its net assets in securities of issuers or companies that are economically tied to different countries throughout the world, excluding the United States. The Portfolio may, under\\n41\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson Global Technology Portfolio\\n \\n\\nunusual circumstances, invest in a single country. The Portfolio may have significant exposure to emerging markets. The Portfolio may also invest in U.S. and foreign debt securities. From time to time, the Portfolio may invest in shares of companies through initial public offerings.\\nThe portfolio managers apply a \\u201cbottom up\\u201d approach in choosing investments. In other words, the portfolio managers look at companies one at a time to determine if a company is an attractive investment opportunity and if it is consistent with the Portfolio\\u2019s investment policies.\\nThe Portfolio may also take long or short positions in derivatives, which are instruments that have a value derived from, or directly linked to, an underlying asset, such as equity securities, fixed-income securities, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indices. For purposes of meeting its 80% investment policy, the Portfolio may include derivatives that have characteristics similar to the securities in which the Portfolio may directly invest. The types of derivatives in which the Portfolio may invest include options, futures, swaps, warrants, and forward currency contracts. The Portfolio may use derivatives to hedge, to earn income or enhance returns, as a substitute for securities in which the Portfolio invests, to increase or decrease the Portfolio\\u2019s exposure to a particular market, to adjust the Portfolio\\u2019s currency exposure relative to its benchmark index, to gain access to foreign markets where direct investment may be restricted or unavailable, or to manage the Portfolio\\u2019s risk profile.\\nThe Portfolio may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, in an amount equal to up to one-third of its total assets as determined at the time of the loan origination.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS\\nThe biggest risk is that the Portfolio\\u2019s returns will vary, and you could lose money. The Portfolio is designed for long-term investors seeking an equity portfolio, including common stocks. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than many other investment choices.\\nForeign Exposure Risk.  The Portfolio normally has significant exposure to foreign markets as a result of its investments in foreign securities, including investments in emerging markets, which can be more volatile than the U.S. markets. As a result, its returns and net asset value may be affected to a large degree by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or political or economic conditions in a particular country. In some foreign markets, there may not be protection against failure by other parties to complete transactions. It may not be possible for the Portfolio to repatriate capital, dividends, interest, and other income from a particular country or governmental entity. In addition, a market swing in one or more countries or regions where the Portfolio has invested a significant amount of its assets may have a greater effect on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance than it would in a more geographically diversified portfolio. To the extent the Portfolio invests in foreign debt securities, such investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Additionally, investments in securities of foreign governments involve the risk that a foreign government may not be willing or able to pay interest or repay principal when due. The Portfolio\\u2019s investments in emerging market countries may involve risks greater than, or in addition to, the risks of investing in more developed countries.\\nEmerging Markets Risk.  The risks of foreign investing mentioned above are heightened when investing in emerging markets. Emerging markets securities involve a number of additional risks, which may result from less government supervision and regulation of business and industry practices (including the potential lack of strict finance and accounting controls and standards), stock exchanges, brokers, and listed companies, making these investments potentially more volatile in price and less liquid than investments in developed securities markets, resulting in greater risk to investors. There is a risk in developing countries that a future economic or political crisis could lead to price controls, forced mergers of companies, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition or enforcement of foreign ownership limits, seizure, nationalization, sanctions or imposition of restrictions by various governmental entities on investment and trading, or creation of government monopolies, any of which may have a detrimental effect on the Portfolio\\u2019s investments. In addition, the Portfolio\\u2019s investments may be denominated in foreign currencies and therefore, changes in the value of a country\\u2019s currency compared to the U.S. dollar may affect the value of the Portfolio\\u2019s investments. To the extent that the Portfolio invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of emerging markets issuers in or companies of a single country or region, it is more likely to be impacted by events or conditions affecting that country or region, which could have a negative impact on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance. Some of the risks of investing directly in foreign and emerging market securities may be reduced when the Portfolio invests indirectly in foreign securities through various other investment vehicles including derivatives, which also\\n42\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson Global Technology Portfolio\\n \\n\\ninvolve other risks. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 16.2% of the Portfolio\\u2019s investments were in emerging markets (i.e., countries included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm).\\nMarket Risk.  The value of the Portfolio\\u2019s holdings may decrease if the value of an individual company or security, or multiple companies or securities, in the Portfolio decreases or if the portfolio managers\\u2019 belief about a company\\u2019s intrinsic worth is incorrect. Further, regardless of how well individual companies or securities perform, the value of the Portfolio\\u2019s holdings could also decrease if there are deteriorating economic or market conditions. It is important to understand that the value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, in response to changes in the market, and you could lose money. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, economic sector, or the market as a whole.\\nGrowth Securities Risk.  The Portfolio invests in companies that the portfolio managers believe have growth potential. Securities of companies perceived to be \\u201cgrowth\\u201d companies may be more volatile than other stocks and may involve special risks. If the portfolio managers\\u2019 perception of a company\\u2019s growth potential is not realized, the securities purchased may not perform as expected, reducing the Portfolio\\u2019s returns. In addition, because different types of stocks tend to shift in and out of favor depending on market and economic conditions, \\u201cgrowth\\u201d stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of securities.\\nIndustry Risk.  Although the Portfolio does not concentrate its investments in specific industries or industry sectors, it may invest in companies related in such a way that they react similarly to certain market pressures. As a result, the Portfolio\\u2019s returns may be considerably more volatile than the returns of a fund that does not invest in similarly related companies.\\nDerivatives Risk.  Derivatives can be highly volatile and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying referenced securities or asset. Gains or losses from a derivative investment can be substantially greater than the derivative\\u2019s original cost, and can therefore involve leverage. Leverage may cause the Portfolio to be more volatile than if it had not used leverage. Derivatives can be complex instruments and may involve analysis that differs from that required for other investment types used by the Portfolio. If the value of a derivative does not correlate well with the particular market or other asset class to which the derivative is intended to provide exposure, the derivative may not produce the anticipated result. Derivatives can also reduce the opportunity for gain or result in losses by offsetting positive returns in other investments. Derivatives can be less liquid than other types of investments and entail the risk that the counterparty will default on its payment obligations. If the counterparty to a derivative transaction defaults, the Portfolio would risk the loss of the net amount of the payments that it contractually is entitled to receive. To the extent the Portfolio enters into short derivative positions, the Portfolio may be exposed to risks similar to those associated with short sales, including the risk that the Portfolio\\u2019s losses are theoretically unlimited. Hedging with derivatives may increase expenses, and there is no guarantee that a hedging strategy will work. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains or cause losses if the market moves in a manner different from that anticipated by the Portfolio or if the cost of the derivative outweighs the benefit of the hedge.\\nGeographic Concentration Risk.  To the extent the Portfolio invests a substantial amount of its assets in issuers located in a single country or region, the economic, political, social, regulatory or other developments or conditions within such country or region will generally have a greater effect on the Portfolio than they would on a more geographically diversified fund, which may result in greater losses and volatility. Adverse developments in certain regions could also adversely affect securities of other countries whose economies appear to be unrelated and could have a negative impact on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance.\\nInitial Public Offering Risk.  The Portfolio\\u2019s purchase of shares issued in an initial public offering (\\u201cIPO\\u201d) exposes it to the risks associated with companies that have little operating history as public companies, as well as to the risks inherent in those sectors of the market where these new issuers operate. Although IPO investments may have had a positive impact on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance in the past, there can be no assurance that the Portfolio will identify favorable IPO investment opportunities in the future. In addition, as the Portfolio increases in size, the impact of IPOs on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance will generally decrease.\\nMid-Sized Companies Risk.  The Portfolio\\u2019s investments in securities issued by mid-sized companies may involve greater risks than are customarily associated with larger, more established companies. Securities issued by mid-sized companies tend to be more volatile than securities issued by larger or more established companies and may underperform as compared to the securities of larger or more established companies.\\nSecurities Lending Risk.  The Portfolio may seek to earn additional income through lending its securities to certain qualified broker-dealers and institutions. There is the risk that when portfolio securities are lent, the securities may not be returned on a timely basis, and the Portfolio may experience delays and costs in recovering the security or gaining access to the collateral\\n43\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson Global Technology Portfolio\\n \\n\\nprovided to the Portfolio to collateralize the loan. If the Portfolio is unable to recover a security on loan, the Portfolio may use the collateral to purchase replacement securities in the market. There is a risk that the value of the collateral could decrease below the cost of the replacement security by the time the replacement investment is made, resulting in a loss to the Portfolio.\\nManagement Risk.  The Portfolio is an actively managed investment portfolio and is therefore subject to the risk that the investment strategies employed for the Portfolio may fail to produce the intended results. The Portfolio may underperform its benchmark index or other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.\\nAn investment in the Portfolio is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nPERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\nThe following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Portfolio by showing how the Portfolio\\u2019s performance has varied over time. The bar chart depicts the change in performance from year to year during the periods indicated, but does not include charges or expenses attributable to any insurance product, which would lower the performance illustrated. The Portfolio does not impose any sales or other charges that would affect total return computations. Total return figures include the effect of the Portfolio\\u2019s expenses. The table compares the average annual returns for the Institutional Shares of the Portfolio for the periods indicated to broad-based securities market indices. All figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions. For certain periods, the Portfolio\\u2019s performance reflects the effect of expense waivers.

J. Bradley Slingerlend, CFA, is Executive Vice President and Co-Portfolio Manager of the Portfolio, which he has managed or co-managed since May 2011.\\nPURCHASE AND SALE OF PORTFOLIO SHARES\\nPurchases of Shares may be made only by the separate accounts of insurance companies for the purpose of funding variable insurance contracts or by certain qualified retirement plans. Redemptions, like purchases, may be effected only through the separate accounts of participating insurance companies or through qualified retirement plans. Requests are duly processed at the NAV next calculated after your order is received in good order by the Portfolio or its agents. Refer to the appropriate separate account prospectus or plan documents for details.\\nTAX INFORMATION\\nBecause Shares of the Portfolio may be purchased only through variable insurance contracts and certain qualified retirement plans, it is anticipated that any income dividends or net capital gains distributions made by the Portfolio will be exempt from current federal income taxation if left to accumulate within the variable insurance contract or qualified retirement plan. The federal income tax status of your investment depends on the features of your qualified retirement plan or variable insurance contract.\\nPAYMENTS TO INSURERS, BROKER-DEALERS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES\\nPortfolio shares are generally available only through an insurer\\u2019s variable contracts, or through certain employer or other retirement plans (Retirement Products). Retirement Products are generally purchased through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary. The Portfolio or its distributor (and/or their related companies) may make payments to the insurer and/or its related companies for distribution and/or other services; some of the payments may go to broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries. These payments may create a conflict of interest for an intermediary, or be a factor in the insurer\\u2019s decision to include the Portfolio as an underlying investment option in a variable contract. Ask your financial advisor, visit your intermediary\\u2019s website, or consult your insurance contract prospectus for more information.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The front-end sales charge applicable to Class T shares is a per-transaction charge, meaning that separate orders will not be aggregated for purposes of calculating the rate of the sales charge payable. An investor transacting in a class of Fund shares without any front-end sales charge, contingent deferred sales charge, or other asset-based fee for sales or distribution may be required to pay a commission to the financial intermediary for effecting such transactions. Such commission rates are set by the financial intermediary and are not reflected in the tables or the example below. You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and members of your immediate family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in certain classes of shares of eligible funds distributed by Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. (the Distributor). More information is available about these and other sales charge discounts and waivers from your financial intermediary, and can be found in the Choosing a Share Class section beginning on page 21 of the Fund\\u2019s prospectus, in Appendix A to the prospectus beginning on page A-1 and in Appendix S to the Statement of Additional Information (SAI) under Sales Charge Waivers beginning on page S-1.\\n    \\nShareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment)\\n \\tClass A\\tClass C\\tClass T\\tClasses Adv,\\nInst, Inst2,\\nInst3 and R\\nMaximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a % of offering price)\\t5.75%\\tNone\\t2.50%\\tNone\\nMaximum deferred sales charge (load) imposed on redemptions (as a % of the lower of the original purchase price or current net asset value)\\t1.00% (a)\\t1.00% (b)\\tNone\\tNone\\n    \\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\n \\tClass A\\tClass Adv\\tClass C\\tClass Inst\\tClass Inst2\\tClass Inst3\\tClass R\\tClass T\\nManagement fees\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\t0.87%\\nDistribution and/or service (12b-1) fees\\t0.25%\\t0.00%\\t1.00%\\t0.00%\\t0.00%\\t0.00%\\t0.50%\\t0.25%\\nOther expenses(c)\\t0.11%\\t0.11%\\t0.11%\\t0.11%\\t0.07%\\t0.02%\\t0.11%\\t0.11%\\nTotal annual Fund operating expenses\\t1.23%\\t0.98%\\t1.98%\\t0.98%\\t0.94%\\t0.89%\\t1.48%\\t1.23%\\n(a)\\tThis charge is imposed on certain investments of between $1 million and $50 million redeemed within 18 months after purchase, as follows: 1.00% if redeemed within 12 months after purchase, and 0.50% if redeemed more than 12, but less than 18, months after purchase, with certain limited exceptions.\\n(b)\\tThis charge applies to redemptions within 12 months after purchase, with certain limited exceptions.\\n(c)\\tOther expenses have been restated to reflect current transfer agency fees paid by the Fund.\\nExample\\nThe following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 39% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of companies operating in the communications, information and related industries. Accordingly, the Fund invests in companies operating in the information technology and telecommunications sectors as well as those in the media industry. In addition, as noted above, the Fund may invest in related industries, which provides the Fund with broad investment flexibility to invest in any industry and many of the issuers in which the Fund invests are technology and technology-related companies. These technology and technology-related companies may include companies operating in any industry, including but not limited to software, hardware, health care, medical technology and technology services, such as the internet.\\nThe Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign investments.\\nThe Fund may invest in securities of large capitalization companies that are well established and can be expected to grow with the market. The Fund may also invest in small-to-medium size capitalization companies that the Fund\\u2019s portfolio managers believe provide opportunities to benefit from the rapidly changing technologies and the expansion of the communications, information and related industries. These securities generally include common stocks.\\nThe Fund is non-diversified, which means that it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of fewer issuers than can a diversified fund.\\nPrincipal Risks\\nAn investment in the Fund involves risks, including those described below. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective and you may lose money. The value of the Fund\\u2019s holdings may decline, and the Fund\\u2019s net asset value (NAV) and share price may go down. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nActive Management Risk. Due to its active management, the Fund could underperform its benchmark index and/or other funds with similar investment objectives and/or strategies.\\nForeign Securities Risk. Investments in or exposure to foreign securities involve certain risks not associated with investments in or exposure to securities of U.S. companies. Foreign securities subject the Fund to the risks associated with investing in the particular country of an issuer, including political, regulatory, economic, social, diplomatic and other conditions or events (including, for example, military confrontations, war and terrorism),\\n4\\tPROSPECTUS 2018\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA SELIGMAN COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION FUND\\nSUMMARY OF THE FUND (continued)\\noccurring in the country or region, as well as risks associated with less developed custody and settlement practices. Foreign securities may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of U.S. companies, and are subject to the risks associated with potential imposition of economic and other sanctions against a particular foreign country, its nationals or industries or businesses within the country. In addition, foreign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on the Fund\\u2019s income, capital gains or proceeds from the disposition of foreign securities, which could reduce the Fund\\u2019s return on such securities. The performance of the Fund may also be negatively affected by fluctuations in a foreign currency's strength or weakness relative to the U.S. dollar, particularly to the extent the Fund invests a significant percentage of its assets in foreign securities or other assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\\nGrowth Securities Risk. Growth securities typically trade at a higher multiple of earnings than other types of equity securities. Accordingly, the market values of growth securities may never reach their expected market value and may decline in price. In addition, growth securities, at times, may not perform as well as value securities or the stock market in general, and may be out of favor with investors for varying periods of time.\\nIssuer Risk. An issuer in which the Fund invests or to which it has exposure may perform poorly, and the value of its securities may therefore decline, which would negatively affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, breakthroughs in technology, reliance on suppliers, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, natural disasters or other events, conditions or factors. The market capitalization of an issuer may also impact its risk profile. Investments in larger, more established companies may involve certain risks associated with their larger size. For instance, larger, more established companies may be less able to respond quickly to new competitive challenges, such as changes in consumer tastes or innovation from smaller competitors. Also, larger companies are sometimes less able to attain the high growth rates of successful smaller companies, especially during extended periods of economic expansion.\\nLiquidity Risk. Liquidity risk is the risk associated with any event, circumstance, or characteristic of an investment or market that negatively impacts the Fund\\u2019s ability to sell, or realize the proceeds from the sale of, an investment at a desirable time or price. Liquidity risk may arise because of, for example, a lack of marketability of the investment, which means that when seeking to sell its portfolio investments, the Fund could find that selling is more difficult than anticipated, especially during times of high market volatility. Market participants attempting to sell the same or a similar instrument at the same time as the Fund could exacerbate the Fund\\u2019s exposure to liquidity risk. The Fund may have to accept a lower selling price for the holding, sell other liquid or more liquid investments that it might otherwise prefer to hold (thereby increasing the proportion of the Fund\\u2019s investments in less liquid or illiquid securities), or forego another more appealing investment opportunity. Certain investments that were liquid when purchased by the Fund may later become illiquid, particularly in times of overall economic distress. Changing regulatory, market or other conditions or environments (for example, the interest rate or credit environments) may also adversely affect the liquidity and the price of the Fund's investments. Judgment plays a larger role in valuing illiquid or less liquid investments as compared to valuing liquid or more liquid investments. Price volatility may be higher for illiquid or less liquid investments as a result of, for example, the relatively less frequent pricing of such securities (as compared to liquid or more liquid investments). Generally, the less liquid the market at the time the Fund sells a portfolio investment, the greater the risk of loss or decline of value to the Fund. Overall market liquidity and other factors can lead to an increase in redemptions, which may negatively impact Fund performance and NAV, including, for example, if the Fund is forced to sell investments in a down market. Foreign securities can present enhanced liquidity risks, including as a result of less developed custody, settlement or other practices of foreign markets.\\nMarket Risk. Market risk refers to the possibility that the market values of securities or other investments that the Fund holds will fall, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, or fail to rise. An investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods.\\nNon-Diversified Fund Risk. The Fund is non-diversified, which generally means that it will invest a greater percentage of its total assets in the securities of fewer issuers than a \\u201cdiversified\\u201d fund. This increases the risk that a change in the value of any one investment held by the Fund could affect the overall value of the Fund more than it would affect that of a diversified fund holding a greater number of investments. Accordingly, the Fund's value will likely be more volatile than the value of a more diversified fund.\\nPROSPECTUS 2018\\t5\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nCOLUMBIA SELIGMAN COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION FUND\\nSUMMARY OF THE FUND (continued)\\nSector Risk. At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business within one or more economic sectors, including the technology and technology-related sectors. Companies in the same sector may be similarly affected by economic, regulatory, political or market events or conditions, which may make the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that sector than funds that invest more broadly. Generally, the more broadly the Fund invests, the more it spreads risk and potentially reduces the risks of loss and volatility.\\nInformation Technology and Technology-Related Sectors. The Fund may be more susceptible to the particular risks that may affect companies in the information technology sector, as well as other technology-related sectors (collectively, the technology sectors) than if it were invested in a wider variety of companies in unrelated sectors. Companies in the technology sectors are subject to certain risks, including the risk that new services, equipment or technologies will not be accepted by consumers and businesses or will become rapidly obsolete. Performance of such companies may be affected by factors including obtaining and protecting patents (or the failure to do so) and significant competitive pressures, including aggressive pricing of their products or services, new market entrants, competition for market share and short product cycles due to an accelerated rate of technological developments. Such competitive pressures may lead to limited earnings and/or falling profit margins. As a result, the value of their securities may fall or fail to rise. In addition, many technology sector companies have limited operating histories and prices of these companies\\u2019 securities historically have been more volatile than other securities, especially over the short term.\\nSmall- and Mid-Cap Company Securities Risk. Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies (small- and mid-cap companies) often involve greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies (larger companies) because small- and mid-cap companies tend to have less predictable earnings and may lack the management experience, financial resources, product diversification and competitive strengths of larger companies. Securities of small- and mid-cap companies may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of larger companies.\\nPerformance Information\\nThe following bar chart and table show you how the Fund has performed in the past, and can help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the Fund\\u2019s Class A share performance (without sales charges) has varied for each full calendar year shown. If the sales charges were reflected, returns shown would be lower. The table below the bar chart compares the Fund\\u2019s returns (after applicable sales charges shown in the Shareholder Fees table in this prospectus) for the periods shown with a broad measure of market performance.\\nThe performance of one or more share classes shown in the table below begins before the indicated inception date for such share class. The returns shown for each such share class include the returns of the Fund\\u2019s Class A shares (without applicable sales charges and adjusted to reflect the higher class-related operating expenses of such share classes, where applicable) for periods prior to its inception date. Share classes with expenses that are higher than Class A shares will have performance that is lower than Class A shares (without sales charges). Except for differences in annual returns resulting from differences in expenses and sales charges (where applicable), the share classes of the Fund would have substantially similar annual returns because all share classes of the Fund invest in the same portfolio of securities.\\nThe after-tax returns shown in the Average Annual Total Returns table below are calculated using the highest historical individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates in effect during the period indicated in the table and do not reflect the impact of state, local or foreign taxes. Your actual after-tax returns will depend on your personal tax situation and may differ from those shown in the table. In addition, the after-tax returns shown in the table do not apply to shares held in tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k) plans or Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). The after-tax returns are shown only for Class A shares and will vary for other share classes.\\nThe Fund\\u2019s past performance (before and after taxes) is no guarantee of how the Fund will perform in the future.

For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated:\\n\\n1 year \\t$48 \\n3 years \\t$149 \\n5 years \\t$260 \\n10 years \\t$585 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe fund will not incur transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells shares of underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio), but it could incur transaction costs if it were to buy and sell other types of securities directly. If the fund were to buy and sell other types of securities directly, a higher portfolio turnover rate could indicate higher transaction costs and could result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. Such costs, if incurred, would not be reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example and would affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 46% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nInvesting primarily in a combination of Fidelity\\u00ae domestic equity funds, international equity funds, bond funds, and short-term funds (underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds) to seek to achieve the fund's investment objective consistent with a payment strategy to be administered through a complementary systematic withdrawal plan.\\nAllocating assets according to a stable neutral asset allocation strategy shown in the glide path below. FMR Co., Inc. (the Adviser) may modify the fund\\u2019s neutral asset allocations from time to time when in the interests of shareholders.\\nBuying and selling futures contracts (both long and short positions) in an effort to manage cash flows efficiently, remain fully invested, or facilitate asset allocation.\\n\\nAllocating assets among underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds and futures according to a stable neutral asset allocation of approximately:\\n   \\tDomestic Equity Funds* \\t17% \\n   \\tInternational Equity Funds* \\t7% \\n   \\tBond Funds* \\t46% \\n   \\tShort-Term Funds* \\t30% \\n\\n* The Adviser may change these percentages over time. As a result of the active asset allocation strategy (discussed below), actual allocations may differ from the neutral allocations above.\\n\\nThe Adviser may use an active asset allocation strategy to increase or decrease neutral asset class exposures reflected above by up to 10% for equity funds, bond funds and short-term funds to reflect the Adviser's market outlook, which is primarily focused on the intermediate term. The asset allocations in the glide path and pie chart above are referred to as neutral because they do not reflect any decisions made by the Adviser to overweight or underweight an asset class.\\nThe fund's investment objective is intended to support a payment strategy designed to be implemented through a shareholder's voluntary participation in a complementary systematic withdrawal plan that will enable shareholders to receive regular payments from the fund based on their expected required minimum distributions from certain types of retirement accounts as mandated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). However, shareholders may invest in the fund and not participate in the plan.\\n\\nInvestors should refer to the \\\"Features and Policies\\\" section of the prospectus for a summary of how the payment strategy and plan are designed to operate.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nThe fund is designed for investors who seek to convert accumulated assets into regular payments over time. A shareholder's participation in the systematic withdrawal plan will result in the gradual withdrawal of the value of the shareholder's account in the fund. The fund's share price fluctuates, which means you could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nAsset Allocation Risk.  The fund is subject to risks resulting from the Adviser's asset allocation decisions. If FMRC's asset allocation strategy does not work as intended, the fund may not achieve its objective. If the fund is unable to achieve its objective, the payment strategy may not work as intended. The selection of underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among various asset classes could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives. In addition, the fund's active asset allocation strategy may cause the fund to have a risk profile different than that portrayed above from time to time and may increase losses.\\nInvesting in Other Funds.  The fund bears all risks of investment strategies employed by the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives.\\nStock Market Volatility.  Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Different parts of the market, including different market sectors, and different types of securities can react differently to these developments.\\nInterest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt or money market security to decrease.\\nForeign Exposure.  Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, can be more volatile than the U.S. market due to increased risks of adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can perform differently from the U.S. market.\\nIndustry Exposure.  Market conditions, interest rates, and economic, regulatory, or financial developments could significantly affect a single industry or group of related industries.\\nPrepayment.  The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security's maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest rates change.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease. Lower-quality debt securities (those of less than investment-grade quality, also referred to as high yield debt securities or junk bonds) and certain types of other securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality of the issuer. The value of lower-quality debt securities and certain types of other securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.\\nCorrelation to Index.  The performance of an underlying index fund and its index may vary somewhat due to factors such as fees and expenses of the underlying fund, transaction costs, sample selection, regulatory restrictions, and timing differences associated with additions to and deletions from the index.\\nPassive Management Risk.  An underlying fund is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of an underlying fund's index or of the actual securities included in the index. This differs from an actively managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, an underlying fund's performance could be lower than actively managed funds that may shift their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers.\\nLeverage Risk.  Leverage can increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly.\\nInflation-Protected Debt Exposure.  Increases in real interest rates can cause the price of inflation-protected debt securities to decrease. Interest payments on inflation-protected debt securities can be unpredictable.\\nCommodity-Linked Investing.  The value of commodities and commodity-linked investments may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as weather, political, tax, and other regulatory and market developments. Commodity-linked investments may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying commodity, instruments, or measures.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund. The information illustrates the changes in the performance of the fund's shares from year to year and compares the performance of the fund's shares to the performance of a securities market index and an additional index over various periods of time.

Owners of variable insurance contracts that invest in the Shares should refer to the variable insurance contract prospectus for a description of fees and expenses, as the following table and examples do not reflect deductions at the separate account level or contract level for any charges that may be incurred under a contract. Inclusion of these charges would increase the fees and expenses described below.\\nANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\t \\t \\nManagement Fees\\t \\t0.64%\\nOther Expenses\\t \\t0.12%\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\t \\t0.76%\\n  \\nEXAMPLE:\\nThe Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Portfolio with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Portfolio for the time periods indicated, reinvest all dividends and distributions, and then redeem all of your Shares at the end of each period. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Portfolio\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n \\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nInstitutional Shares\\t$\\u200278\\t$\\u2002243\\t$\\u2002422\\t$\\u2002942\\n  \\nPortfolio Turnover:  The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Portfolio\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Portfolio\\u2019s turnover rate was 23% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES\\nThe Portfolio pursues its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of companies that the portfolio managers believe will benefit significantly from advances or improvements in technology. These companies generally fall into two categories:\\n\\u2022\\tcompanies that the portfolio managers believe have or will develop products, processes, or services that will provide significant technological advancements or improvements; and\\n\\u2022\\tcompanies that the portfolio managers believe rely extensively on technology in connection with their operations or services.\\nSome of the industries and companies likely to be represented in the Portfolio\\u2019s holdings include e-commerce (companies doing business through the Internet); computer (hardware and software); communications (voice, data, and wireless); industrials; Internet (software, services, and infrastructure equipment); and media and entertainment.\\nThe Portfolio implements this policy by investing primarily in equity securities of U.S. and foreign companies selected for their growth potential. The Portfolio typically invests at least 40% of its net assets in securities of issuers or companies that are economically tied to different countries throughout the world, excluding the United States. The Portfolio may, under\\n41\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson Global Technology Portfolio\\n \\n\\nunusual circumstances, invest in a single country. The Portfolio may have significant exposure to emerging markets. The Portfolio may also invest in U.S. and foreign debt securities. From time to time, the Portfolio may invest in shares of companies through initial public offerings.\\nThe portfolio managers apply a \\u201cbottom up\\u201d approach in choosing investments. In other words, the portfolio managers look at companies one at a time to determine if a company is an attractive investment opportunity and if it is consistent with the Portfolio\\u2019s investment policies.\\nThe Portfolio may also take long or short positions in derivatives, which are instruments that have a value derived from, or directly linked to, an underlying asset, such as equity securities, fixed-income securities, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indices. For purposes of meeting its 80% investment policy, the Portfolio may include derivatives that have characteristics similar to the securities in which the Portfolio may directly invest. The types of derivatives in which the Portfolio may invest include options, futures, swaps, warrants, and forward currency contracts. The Portfolio may use derivatives to hedge, to earn income or enhance returns, as a substitute for securities in which the Portfolio invests, to increase or decrease the Portfolio\\u2019s exposure to a particular market, to adjust the Portfolio\\u2019s currency exposure relative to its benchmark index, to gain access to foreign markets where direct investment may be restricted or unavailable, or to manage the Portfolio\\u2019s risk profile.\\nThe Portfolio may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, in an amount equal to up to one-third of its total assets as determined at the time of the loan origination.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS\\nThe biggest risk is that the Portfolio\\u2019s returns will vary, and you could lose money. The Portfolio is designed for long-term investors seeking an equity portfolio, including common stocks. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than many other investment choices.\\nForeign Exposure Risk.  The Portfolio normally has significant exposure to foreign markets as a result of its investments in foreign securities, including investments in emerging markets, which can be more volatile than the U.S. markets. As a result, its returns and net asset value may be affected to a large degree by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or political or economic conditions in a particular country. In some foreign markets, there may not be protection against failure by other parties to complete transactions. It may not be possible for the Portfolio to repatriate capital, dividends, interest, and other income from a particular country or governmental entity. In addition, a market swing in one or more countries or regions where the Portfolio has invested a significant amount of its assets may have a greater effect on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance than it would in a more geographically diversified portfolio. To the extent the Portfolio invests in foreign debt securities, such investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Additionally, investments in securities of foreign governments involve the risk that a foreign government may not be willing or able to pay interest or repay principal when due. The Portfolio\\u2019s investments in emerging market countries may involve risks greater than, or in addition to, the risks of investing in more developed countries.\\nEmerging Markets Risk.  The risks of foreign investing mentioned above are heightened when investing in emerging markets. Emerging markets securities involve a number of additional risks, which may result from less government supervision and regulation of business and industry practices (including the potential lack of strict finance and accounting controls and standards), stock exchanges, brokers, and listed companies, making these investments potentially more volatile in price and less liquid than investments in developed securities markets, resulting in greater risk to investors. There is a risk in developing countries that a future economic or political crisis could lead to price controls, forced mergers of companies, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition or enforcement of foreign ownership limits, seizure, nationalization, sanctions or imposition of restrictions by various governmental entities on investment and trading, or creation of government monopolies, any of which may have a detrimental effect on the Portfolio\\u2019s investments. In addition, the Portfolio\\u2019s investments may be denominated in foreign currencies and therefore, changes in the value of a country\\u2019s currency compared to the U.S. dollar may affect the value of the Portfolio\\u2019s investments. To the extent that the Portfolio invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of emerging markets issuers in or companies of a single country or region, it is more likely to be impacted by events or conditions affecting that country or region, which could have a negative impact on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance. Some of the risks of investing directly in foreign and emerging market securities may be reduced when the Portfolio invests indirectly in foreign securities through various other investment vehicles including derivatives, which also\\n42\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson Global Technology Portfolio\\n \\n\\ninvolve other risks. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 16.2% of the Portfolio\\u2019s investments were in emerging markets (i.e., countries included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm).\\nMarket Risk.  The value of the Portfolio\\u2019s holdings may decrease if the value of an individual company or security, or multiple companies or securities, in the Portfolio decreases or if the portfolio managers\\u2019 belief about a company\\u2019s intrinsic worth is incorrect. Further, regardless of how well individual companies or securities perform, the value of the Portfolio\\u2019s holdings could also decrease if there are deteriorating economic or market conditions. It is important to understand that the value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, in response to changes in the market, and you could lose money. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, economic sector, or the market as a whole.\\nGrowth Securities Risk.  The Portfolio invests in companies that the portfolio managers believe have growth potential. Securities of companies perceived to be \\u201cgrowth\\u201d companies may be more volatile than other stocks and may involve special risks. If the portfolio managers\\u2019 perception of a company\\u2019s growth potential is not realized, the securities purchased may not perform as expected, reducing the Portfolio\\u2019s returns. In addition, because different types of stocks tend to shift in and out of favor depending on market and economic conditions, \\u201cgrowth\\u201d stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of securities.\\nIndustry Risk.  Although the Portfolio does not concentrate its investments in specific industries or industry sectors, it may invest in companies related in such a way that they react similarly to certain market pressures. As a result, the Portfolio\\u2019s returns may be considerably more volatile than the returns of a fund that does not invest in similarly related companies.\\nDerivatives Risk.  Derivatives can be highly volatile and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying referenced securities or asset. Gains or losses from a derivative investment can be substantially greater than the derivative\\u2019s original cost, and can therefore involve leverage. Leverage may cause the Portfolio to be more volatile than if it had not used leverage. Derivatives can be complex instruments and may involve analysis that differs from that required for other investment types used by the Portfolio. If the value of a derivative does not correlate well with the particular market or other asset class to which the derivative is intended to provide exposure, the derivative may not produce the anticipated result. Derivatives can also reduce the opportunity for gain or result in losses by offsetting positive returns in other investments. Derivatives can be less liquid than other types of investments and entail the risk that the counterparty will default on its payment obligations. If the counterparty to a derivative transaction defaults, the Portfolio would risk the loss of the net amount of the payments that it contractually is entitled to receive. To the extent the Portfolio enters into short derivative positions, the Portfolio may be exposed to risks similar to those associated with short sales, including the risk that the Portfolio\\u2019s losses are theoretically unlimited. Hedging with derivatives may increase expenses, and there is no guarantee that a hedging strategy will work. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains or cause losses if the market moves in a manner different from that anticipated by the Portfolio or if the cost of the derivative outweighs the benefit of the hedge.\\nGeographic Concentration Risk.  To the extent the Portfolio invests a substantial amount of its assets in issuers located in a single country or region, the economic, political, social, regulatory or other developments or conditions within such country or region will generally have a greater effect on the Portfolio than they would on a more geographically diversified fund, which may result in greater losses and volatility. Adverse developments in certain regions could also adversely affect securities of other countries whose economies appear to be unrelated and could have a negative impact on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance.\\nInitial Public Offering Risk.  The Portfolio\\u2019s purchase of shares issued in an initial public offering (\\u201cIPO\\u201d) exposes it to the risks associated with companies that have little operating history as public companies, as well as to the risks inherent in those sectors of the market where these new issuers operate. Although IPO investments may have had a positive impact on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance in the past, there can be no assurance that the Portfolio will identify favorable IPO investment opportunities in the future. In addition, as the Portfolio increases in size, the impact of IPOs on the Portfolio\\u2019s performance will generally decrease.\\nMid-Sized Companies Risk.  The Portfolio\\u2019s investments in securities issued by mid-sized companies may involve greater risks than are customarily associated with larger, more established companies. Securities issued by mid-sized companies tend to be more volatile than securities issued by larger or more established companies and may underperform as compared to the securities of larger or more established companies.\\nSecurities Lending Risk.  The Portfolio may seek to earn additional income through lending its securities to certain qualified broker-dealers and institutions. There is the risk that when portfolio securities are lent, the securities may not be returned on a timely basis, and the Portfolio may experience delays and costs in recovering the security or gaining access to the collateral\\n43\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson Global Technology Portfolio\\n \\n\\nprovided to the Portfolio to collateralize the loan. If the Portfolio is unable to recover a security on loan, the Portfolio may use the collateral to purchase replacement securities in the market. There is a risk that the value of the collateral could decrease below the cost of the replacement security by the time the replacement investment is made, resulting in a loss to the Portfolio.\\nManagement Risk.  The Portfolio is an actively managed investment portfolio and is therefore subject to the risk that the investment strategies employed for the Portfolio may fail to produce the intended results. The Portfolio may underperform its benchmark index or other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.\\nAn investment in the Portfolio is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nPERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\nThe following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Portfolio by showing how the Portfolio\\u2019s performance has varied over time. The bar chart depicts the change in performance from year to year during the periods indicated, but does not include charges or expenses attributable to any insurance product, which would lower the performance illustrated. The Portfolio does not impose any sales or other charges that would affect total return computations. Total return figures include the effect of the Portfolio\\u2019s expenses. The table compares the average annual returns for the Institutional Shares of the Portfolio for the periods indicated to broad-based securities market indices. All figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions. For certain periods, the Portfolio\\u2019s performance reflects the effect of expense waivers. Without the effect of these expense waivers, the performance shown would have been lower.\\nThe Portfolio\\u2019s past performance does not necessarily indicate how it will perform in the future.

J. Bradley Slingerlend, CFA, is Executive Vice President and Co-Portfolio Manager of the Portfolio, which he has managed or co-managed since May 2011.\\nPURCHASE AND SALE OF PORTFOLIO SHARES\\nPurchases of Shares may be made only by the separate accounts of insurance companies for the purpose of funding variable insurance contracts or by certain qualified retirement plans. Redemptions, like purchases, may be effected only through the separate accounts of participating insurance companies or through qualified retirement plans. Requests are duly processed at the NAV next calculated after your order is received in good order by the Portfolio or its agents. Refer to the appropriate separate account prospectus or plan documents for details.\\nTAX INFORMATION\\nBecause Shares of the Portfolio may be purchased only through variable insurance contracts and certain qualified retirement plans, it is anticipated that any income dividends or net capital gains distributions made by the Portfolio will be exempt from current federal income taxation if left to accumulate within the variable insurance contract or qualified retirement plan. The federal income tax status of your investment depends on the features of your qualified retirement plan or variable insurance contract.\\nPAYMENTS TO INSURERS, BROKER-DEALERS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES\\nPortfolio shares are generally available only through an insurer\\u2019s variable contracts, or through certain employer or other retirement plans (Retirement Products). Retirement Products are generally purchased through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary.

As a result, an underlying fund's performance could be lower than actively managed funds that may shift their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers. The selection of underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among various asset classes could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.
